WEBVTT

00:00.810 --> 00:03.510
Well we're getting close to finishing the MEK here.

00:03.530 --> 00:06.080
But there are a couple of things that we should do.

00:06.600 --> 00:14.820
I think first of all I'm going to create a couple of rocket boosters on the bottom of the jet pack here.

00:15.060 --> 00:19.650
But as I'm looking at this I'm beginning to see a problem here.

00:19.650 --> 00:21.320
Let me show you what I mean.

00:21.390 --> 00:29.480
See these pinching little areas that are kind of pinching that tells me that there's a problem there.

00:29.850 --> 00:35.400
If we tap into edit mode you can see yeah look at these edges.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.460
How they're being pulled down to these points.

00:39.810 --> 00:50.100
And if I go into the modifiers tab and just turn off the display modifier here you can see that we can't

00:50.100 --> 00:52.910
really see any problem here per se.

00:53.400 --> 00:59.210
Only when you turn on the subdivision surface modifier do we see a problem.

00:59.400 --> 01:07.890
And that's actually a pretty good way to test a mesh especially if you've mirrored it and then sealed

01:07.890 --> 01:14.490
it back up the subdivision surface modifier is just a good way to test and make sure that all the points

01:14.490 --> 01:17.010
have been merged together.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.410
So for this we can see that they have it.

01:19.460 --> 01:20.670
There's a problem.

01:20.670 --> 01:27.960
And when you see something like this your first instinct may be to go straight to these points and try

01:27.960 --> 01:30.060
and figure out what's wrong with these.

01:30.300 --> 01:34.680
But in reality it's this one between these two.

01:34.860 --> 01:36.770
That is the problem.

01:36.900 --> 01:39.510
And if we come in here let's take a look.

01:39.540 --> 01:48.360
My guess is is that this is a point that we've got two points here that aren't merged together.

01:48.450 --> 01:49.960
So what to do about that.

01:50.190 --> 01:54.130
Well I'm going to undo here to put these back the way they were.

01:54.270 --> 01:58.510
What we need to do is just merge them together so I'm going to select one.

01:58.500 --> 02:05.110
I've got one slug here and then I'm going to shift select the other one and then I'm going to press

02:05.230 --> 02:15.710
Allt m to bring up the merge menu and choose center and that will merge those two together and take

02:15.710 --> 02:21.700
away that tolling that was happening from the points on either side of that.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.080
All right.

02:22.080 --> 02:28.700
So we've cleaned that up a bit and we're going to need to split the body out again.

02:28.770 --> 02:34.860
You can see here that the shoulder hasn't been keeping up with what we've been doing on the shoulder

02:34.950 --> 02:37.030
on this side here.

02:37.230 --> 02:45.060
So we're going to have to ultimately split the body down the middle and re mirror it to get that information

02:45.090 --> 02:46.230
over here again.

02:47.410 --> 02:53.700
And when we do we'll make sure to look for problem points like that again.

02:54.940 --> 02:55.310
All right.

02:55.330 --> 03:03.070
So let's take a look at creating the rocket boosters here for this I think I just need a cylinder and

03:03.070 --> 03:05.700
I'm going to place it up in here.

03:05.710 --> 03:14.220
My idea is that he's got this jet pack that allows him to fly down into the environment.

03:14.590 --> 03:17.890
So the 3D cursor is in the center of the grid.

03:17.890 --> 03:23.320
Let's go ahead and go to the Create tab create a cylinder.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.190
Let's take a look at the settings here.

03:26.410 --> 03:27.730
I don't need 32.

03:27.730 --> 03:30.300
I'll take that down to 12 sides.

03:30.310 --> 03:34.160
And for the cap fill I don't need anything on it right now at all.

03:35.160 --> 03:38.780
So now I'll bring it up and place it.

03:38.820 --> 03:46.360
One good way to place an object like this is to actually see it in four different views.

03:46.380 --> 03:53.610
We bring this back down and I'm going to press control alt cue and that will bring up the quad view

03:53.610 --> 03:54.400
here.

03:54.630 --> 04:01.380
And also I'm going to press the T key to get rid of the Tools panel over here and now we can kind of

04:01.380 --> 04:04.300
get a better view of this.

04:04.320 --> 04:12.130
Now if I press the Z key I can really get a good sense of where this object is within my scene.

04:12.330 --> 04:18.980
So I'm going to move this up and hit the G key and move it up scale it down with the key.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.440
And I'm just going to move it into place here.

04:21.690 --> 04:28.980
Kind of looking at all of my views and sometimes this can really help speed things up.

04:30.040 --> 04:30.400
Right.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.000
I'm going to press the period key to zoom in here.

04:33.880 --> 04:39.540
And maybe zoom in here as well and I'll tumble around and see how I'm doing.

04:40.450 --> 04:43.810
So I think I want it kind of like this.

04:44.860 --> 04:49.210
But I'd like it scaled in a bit.

04:49.210 --> 04:54.420
I want it kind of oval like this.

04:54.450 --> 05:01.870
So now I'll press control alt cue again and that'll take me back to the perspective view and I'll tab

05:01.890 --> 05:04.520
into Edit Mode go to edges.

05:05.670 --> 05:09.020
Also like this edge and I'm going to scale this down just a little bit.

05:09.030 --> 05:18.910
So it's kind of funneled down and I think that's what I'm looking for something kind of like this.

05:18.950 --> 05:26.360
Now for the insides I'll just grab this edge now and I'm going to hit the key and click and then hit

05:26.360 --> 05:36.370
the s key and scale in the key again and click and go to my move tool and move it up a bit scaled down

05:36.410 --> 05:41.760
a tad and then the e again scale in.

05:42.130 --> 05:49.180
And now I want to connect these I'll hit the key one more time and click and then I'll press alt M and

05:49.180 --> 05:54.780
merge at the center and that will collapse all of those down into a single point.

05:54.970 --> 05:57.320
So now you can't see up into it.

05:57.340 --> 06:03.250
I don't think we're ever going to be looking up into this like this but that'll just ensure that if

06:03.250 --> 06:06.470
we do we won't see anything up in there.

06:06.580 --> 06:10.680
Now I think I'll go ahead and add a subdivision surface modifier to it.

06:13.790 --> 06:22.430
And I'll turn on the page here increased the subdivisions to two in the viewport I'll come back to the

06:22.430 --> 06:31.260
tool shelf here and click smooth shading and we go all turn off this cage here.

06:31.990 --> 06:35.160
So we can see it a little better in edit mode.

06:35.170 --> 06:36.220
What's happening.

06:37.640 --> 06:46.360
And here's where I'll go ahead and begin adding a few edge loops I'll add one here and bring it down.

06:48.690 --> 06:56.320
And maybe I'll add two along the rim here with the scroll wheel.

06:56.390 --> 07:00.560
So now add a couple in here as well.

07:02.940 --> 07:07.890
And maybe one in here that I can scale out

07:13.000 --> 07:14.180
something like that.

07:15.790 --> 07:18.640
And now I'm just going to duplicate it and move it over.

07:18.640 --> 07:25.040
Let me go to the properties panel with the key and I'm going to scroll up here.

07:25.420 --> 07:30.400
So what I'm going to do is actually copy this I'm going to select it and I'm going to press commander

07:30.430 --> 07:41.840
control to copy and then I'll come back out here and duplicate this with Shiff D and click and I'm going

07:41.840 --> 07:43.300
to move it over.

07:43.460 --> 07:54.470
And now I can type in negative and command or control V to paste and that'll place it the same distance

07:54.470 --> 07:58.230
from the center that the other one was.

07:58.490 --> 08:00.170
So let's see how that looks.

08:01.620 --> 08:02.570
I feel like I need it.

08:02.580 --> 08:04.530
I feel like they need to be a little bit bigger.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.550
I'm going to try this again.

08:06.600 --> 08:14.640
I'm going to scale this this way now like they need a little bit bigger to support the weight of this

08:14.640 --> 08:16.080
big thing here.

08:16.460 --> 08:17.240
Something like that

08:20.290 --> 08:24.980
negative commander control V and enter.

08:25.300 --> 08:28.880
And that will paste that information into that field.

08:29.110 --> 08:32.690
So now we have our jet pack for the Mac.

08:32.710 --> 08:36.350
Let's see how that works as we move forward.

08:36.370 --> 08:47.310
I think I'll go ahead and name these maybe Jet 1 and jet to.

08:47.380 --> 08:53.950
I also had the thought of putting little rubber strips on the bottom of his shoes here.

08:53.980 --> 08:56.520
I don't know why I just think and be kind and cool.

08:56.860 --> 09:05.070
So I'm going to select one of these and maybe select a point that I can snap the cursor to here.

09:06.520 --> 09:17.460
Shift Yes cursor to selected then I'll just go to the Create tab and create cube and that will pop into

09:17.480 --> 09:18.480
there.

09:18.500 --> 09:19.820
I'll scale it down.

09:20.950 --> 09:30.160
And I just want to scale this so it's kind of a flat thin piece kind of like this.

09:30.550 --> 09:37.870
I'm going to press the seven key to go to the top view but I can't see it there so I can actually press

09:37.870 --> 09:44.050
control 7 to look at it from the bottom view.

09:44.080 --> 09:44.800
So there we go.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.040
That's control 7.

09:48.070 --> 09:48.330
All right.

09:48.340 --> 09:55.370
So I'm going to place these I'm going to scale this and move this down here like this.

09:56.620 --> 10:02.930
And I'm going to press the five key to go to orthographic view.

10:03.540 --> 10:11.500
And so now I can see exactly how big this is in comparison to the foot and kind of want it to be like

10:11.500 --> 10:12.000
that

10:15.150 --> 10:17.530
something like this.

10:17.600 --> 10:22.900
And now I think I'd like to delete the face on top.

10:22.900 --> 10:26.050
I won't need that.

10:26.090 --> 10:32.660
I'm going to go ahead and add a subdivision surface modifier to see how it looks and it looks pretty

10:32.660 --> 10:33.390
terrible.

10:33.510 --> 10:41.360
If I tab into edit mode and increase the views to two I'll smooth it in object mode.

10:41.360 --> 10:46.340
I've got to go to object mode to smooth the shading here.

10:46.340 --> 10:54.530
Now back in edit mode let's see how this works let me close this properties panel and I will insert

10:54.590 --> 11:02.290
an edge loop here and I'm going to scroll the mouse wheel to create two and then click twice and I'm

11:02.290 --> 11:10.820
going to go to this scale tool and scale these out like that and I'll do that again the other way like

11:10.910 --> 11:13.590
this and scale those out.

11:15.810 --> 11:19.020
So I should have something like that.

11:19.170 --> 11:23.530
Now I can insert this back up into the foot.

11:23.580 --> 11:28.510
I'm thinking this is going to be like a gray or black rubber substance.

11:28.950 --> 11:37.080
And from here I'll press control seven again and the five key and now I can press shift D and duplicate

11:37.080 --> 11:39.290
these as I need

11:43.810 --> 11:50.990
and maybe I'll do one down here that's kind of smaller so I'll take this down here and scale it down

11:51.990 --> 11:55.440
to take one of these and duplicated up here.

11:58.010 --> 12:02.700
So I'm just trying to add a little detail and interest to the bottom of the feet.

12:02.720 --> 12:07.640
I think we may see the bottom of the feet as he comes down into the environment.

12:11.700 --> 12:12.270
There we go.

12:12.270 --> 12:15.550
So now we've got those pieces on the bottom of the foot.

12:15.720 --> 12:21.440
Ultimately we'll need to join these together into a single object for the wheel here.

12:21.660 --> 12:23.650
And for the toe.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.930
But for right now that's pretty good.

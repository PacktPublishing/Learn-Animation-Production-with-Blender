Well we are to the point where we can actually begin thinking about materials and textures.

00:06.410 --> 00:12.050
I've noticed that when people talk about materials and textures they oftentimes kind of interchange

00:12.050 --> 00:16.500
the two and they really are two separate things.

00:16.520 --> 00:22.790
Materials are what we use to create the basic visual properties of our 3-D objects.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.910
In other words is the object red or blue.

00:25.940 --> 00:27.490
How shiny is it.

00:27.500 --> 00:37.070
Does it have transparency a reflection those basic visual properties are created through our materials.

00:37.070 --> 00:46.550
But if we want to get more detailed and if our 3D objects need something like scratches or rust or lettering

00:46.580 --> 00:55.130
on a sign those kinds of more detailed visual elements that are placed in particular parts of the model

00:55.430 --> 01:03.610
those can be really only done through textures and a texture is a two dimensional image that is applied

01:03.610 --> 01:05.850
to a three dimensional object.

01:06.220 --> 01:14.200
And in addition I guess you can think of it like this we assign textures to materials and then we apply

01:14.200 --> 01:17.300
the material to the 3D objects.

01:17.350 --> 01:20.140
So we'll be working with each of those in turn.

01:20.200 --> 01:27.330
But I think right now what we should be concentrating on is U-V mapping.

01:27.370 --> 01:37.190
So what is U-V mapping UVM mapping is the process of creating a two dimensional representation of our

01:37.190 --> 01:39.620
three dimensional object.

01:39.620 --> 01:48.200
In other words if you can imagine taking an empty cereal box and cutting along the edges and then opening

01:48.200 --> 01:56.090
the cereal box up and spreading it out flat on the kitchen counter that's kind of what U-V mapping is.

01:56.090 --> 02:02.660
It allows us to take the polygons of our three dimensional object and lay them out flat so that we can

02:02.660 --> 02:06.440
paint or apply two dimensional images.

02:06.440 --> 02:16.190
So as I said if you wanted to paint or apply images of scratches or rust or actual lettering on a sign

02:16.700 --> 02:23.780
you would need to use the map your object first so that you can apply those two dimensional images directly

02:23.780 --> 02:29.340
to the two dimensional representation of your 3D object.

02:29.810 --> 02:36.560
And I'm hoping this makes a little more sense as we move through the process but we kind of need to

02:36.590 --> 02:43.670
focus on U-V mapping Now before we begin dealing with materials and textures.

02:43.680 --> 02:50.100
The reason why is because you don't always know where you're going to need a texture and where you can

02:50.100 --> 02:52.740
get away with just using a material.

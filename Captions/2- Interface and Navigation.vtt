00:00.790 --> 00:04.810
The first we should talk a little bit about Blendr and the interface.

00:04.950 --> 00:10.080
If this is your first time using blender it can be a little intimidating to open this up and see all

00:10.080 --> 00:12.890
the buttons and windows and everything.

00:13.050 --> 00:19.890
But let's just take a look at the interface real quick and talk a bit about some of the panels and windows

00:19.890 --> 00:21.720
will be using.

00:21.720 --> 00:28.950
First of all over here on the left side is the Tools panel and this is usually open by default but if

00:28.950 --> 00:35.820
you hit the T key on the keyboard that will close that and open it up so you can hide it away if it's

00:35.820 --> 00:37.120
in the way.

00:37.320 --> 00:44.310
The other panel that's used a lot is the properties panel and that can be accessed by pressing the N

00:44.310 --> 00:48.370
key and that panel will pop up here.

00:48.690 --> 00:55.450
Now you can also use this little Plus key right here to open up the properties panel as well.

00:58.170 --> 01:04.650
This of course is your main 3-D view where we'll be building all of our objects setting up the scene

01:04.650 --> 01:11.550
and animating the World here on the right hand side you've got the outliner which is basically a list

01:11.550 --> 01:19.940
of all the objects in your scene for each of these you can turn off the visibility within the scene.

01:20.100 --> 01:27.720
You can turn off the select ability or restrict it so you cannot selected and you can also turn off

01:27.720 --> 01:32.610
the visibility within the final rendered image or animation here.

01:34.810 --> 01:40.090
Now down below this we've got the properties window which I think can be a bit confusing when we call

01:40.090 --> 01:46.660
this the properties panel and this the properties window but they are both properties.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.450
It's got a lot of different sections to it.

01:49.450 --> 01:57.230
We've got the rendering section went which we'll be using near the end of the modifiers panel here.

01:57.340 --> 02:02.950
The materials window will be going through a lot of these as we move through the series.

02:02.950 --> 02:07.350
But one thing I should mention here is that all of these windows can be changed.

02:07.350 --> 02:10.410
They can be reconfigured and rearranged.

02:10.510 --> 02:19.470
If you look at this button here it's got a list of all the possible windows you can have in your interface.

02:19.480 --> 02:28.240
So this one here that we just took a look at is the Properties window the one above this is the outliner

02:28.420 --> 02:33.490
the one to the left over here is the 3D view.

02:33.490 --> 02:37.900
So each one of these can be changed to anything you want.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.470
So I can change this to a 3D view.

02:40.630 --> 02:47.370
I can change this to a 3-D view and I could change this to the outliner.

02:47.650 --> 02:53.490
So it's completely configurable which can get a little confusing at times but it's also really convenient.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.050
I mean it changes back to the 3D view.

02:57.090 --> 03:05.120
Change this back to the outliner and this one back to the Properties window.

03:05.600 --> 03:14.390
Now down here at the bottom is the timeline and ultimately we'll be animating our Meck character with

03:14.390 --> 03:16.360
the timeline down here.

03:19.090 --> 03:24.640
Now we should also talk about navigating within the 3D view and it can be a little different and a lot

03:24.640 --> 03:25.860
of other programs.

03:26.140 --> 03:33.340
One of the things to be aware of right up front is that by default you select things with the right

03:33.400 --> 03:34.550
mouse button.

03:34.630 --> 03:42.760
So if I click the right mouse button I can then select this cube or this camera or the light in most

03:42.760 --> 03:49.630
programs you select things with the left mouse button you can change that if you like or you can go

03:49.630 --> 04:00.240
to a file user preferences and under input you can change which mouse button you select things with.

04:00.280 --> 04:09.820
So I can change this to the the left mouse button here and click save user settings and then now I can

04:09.820 --> 04:12.910
select things with the left mouse button.

04:12.910 --> 04:18.550
And if this is your first time using blender or you've only used it a little bit and you've found it

04:18.550 --> 04:23.860
very unintuitive to use that right mouse button feel free to change this.

04:23.860 --> 04:28.480
I think it helps people get into blender a lot easier.

04:28.480 --> 04:37.280
I'm kind of old school I'm afraid so I'm going to switch back to the right here now the way you navigate

04:37.280 --> 04:41.260
within the 3D view is with the middle mouse button.

04:41.270 --> 04:51.520
So if I clicked the middle mouse button and drag the mouse I can tumble around if I hold the shift key

04:51.520 --> 05:00.010
down and click and drag the middle mouse button I will pan the scene and if I press the control button

05:00.010 --> 05:05.910
on the keyboard and middle mouse button click and drag I can zoom in and out.

05:05.920 --> 05:14.040
Now you can also scroll the mouse wheel as well to zoom in and out one in the next video we'll talk

05:14.130 --> 05:19.560
about creating and manipulating objects and actually begin modeling our scene.

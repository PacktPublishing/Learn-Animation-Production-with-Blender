WEBVTT

00:00.760 --> 00:06.010
Let's continue working on the Mac here this is just the basis of the body.

00:06.010 --> 00:10.280
We've got a subdivision surface modifier on it.

00:11.090 --> 00:19.490
And we've also got a mirror modifier on it as well to begin adding the other pieces of the body.

00:19.490 --> 00:23.010
I think we need to make this now all one piece.

00:23.020 --> 00:27.720
All one objects so we need to apply the mirror modifier.

00:28.220 --> 00:34.550
And in addition the subdivisions surface modifier is giving us some nice geometry here if we turn it

00:34.550 --> 00:34.790
off.

00:34.790 --> 00:36.680
We see that is pretty blocky.

00:36.800 --> 00:41.820
I'd kind of like to have some more geometry to work with here.

00:42.110 --> 00:45.960
So I think I'll apply the subdivision modifier as well.

00:46.490 --> 00:52.000
So first off I'll just come down here to the mirror modifier and click apply.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.530
And that applies.

00:54.530 --> 01:03.770
So it's now all one object if I hit the tab key and go into vertex mode here I can select a vertex here

01:04.220 --> 01:12.110
and hit the G key to move it around and you can see that that has sealed the center vertices up together

01:12.110 --> 01:12.610
now.

01:12.620 --> 01:13.940
So it's all one piece.

01:13.940 --> 01:21.400
So now if I go back to object mode I can apply the subdivision surface modifier as well.

01:21.530 --> 01:26.320
And now when I hit tab you can see I've got this extra geometry to it.

01:27.450 --> 01:34.420
So now I think I'd like to work on this piece here this this window cockpit type thing.

01:34.550 --> 01:40.740
I get the sense that there's a person in here that they're sitting down kind of in controlling all of

01:40.740 --> 01:42.060
this.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.400
So let's work on that.

01:44.970 --> 01:46.860
There's a couple of ways to do this.

01:47.010 --> 01:53.970
We could just put an object an oval object into there and then call it a day.

01:54.030 --> 02:00.720
But I'd kind of like to have something inside there I'd kind of like to have maybe a chair and controls

02:00.720 --> 02:02.610
and things like that in there.

02:02.610 --> 02:09.690
So what I want to do is actually cut out that oval shape from this piece and to do that I'm going to

02:09.690 --> 02:11.390
use a boolean.

02:11.550 --> 02:17.260
Now a boolean will allow you to take one shape and cut that pattern out of another.

02:17.310 --> 02:24.720
So I'm going to come over here to the Create tab and this time this time I think I'll create a U-V sphere

02:26.010 --> 02:33.780
and I need to pull it out here because it always pops into the scene where ever this 3D cursor is.

02:33.870 --> 02:42.860
And I think I'll just use my scale tool to get it scaled into the right size.

02:42.850 --> 02:54.050
I mean hit the s key and scale it down a bit and maybe move it into place and also use the scale tool

02:54.060 --> 02:56.860
to scale in the Zied just a bit as well.

02:56.860 --> 03:03.430
Now this may not be the actual object that I'm going to use for this but I am going to use it to cut

03:03.430 --> 03:11.400
out a shape from the main object so I'm thinking something about like that.

03:11.780 --> 03:17.360
I'm going to turn off the manipulator here just by clicking this button so it doesn't get in the way

03:17.630 --> 03:25.320
for a moment and take a look at this and that's about what I want I think something like that.

03:25.670 --> 03:27.140
Yeah.

03:27.170 --> 03:33.680
Now the interesting thing about this is I kind of wanted to do two booleans I want to cut this shape

03:34.780 --> 03:41.550
into the main shape here and I'm going to hit command Z to undo.

03:41.630 --> 03:53.810
And I also want to cut this into the smaller shape as well so it's just part of the sphere.

03:53.980 --> 03:56.440
So I'm going to have to think ahead here.

03:56.440 --> 04:03.630
So what I want to do is I'm going to go ahead and select these two and I'm going to press shift d to

04:03.630 --> 04:07.810
duplicate them and then I click.

04:07.870 --> 04:11.540
And now I want to move these over like that.

04:11.820 --> 04:16.610
So I've moved them over this much negative 2.8 or whatever here.

04:16.620 --> 04:28.370
So I could type in just negative 3 so I know that it's negative 3 for both of these.

04:28.460 --> 04:36.740
This is one of the reasons why I tend to try and model in the center of the grid at least up front because

04:37.100 --> 04:40.180
I know I can always get things back to where I want them to be.

04:40.180 --> 04:45.710
By zeroing them out and they'll come back into the center of the grid.

04:45.740 --> 04:50.110
All right so I've got these two collections of objects here.

04:50.230 --> 04:53.650
I'm going to pass the key to get rid of that panel.

04:53.720 --> 05:01.070
So what I want to do is cut this shape into this object so I'm going to select the main body here and

05:01.070 --> 05:03.180
that's called temporarily.

05:03.200 --> 05:13.260
At least that's called cube and I'm going to select the ADD modifier dropdown select boolean and for

05:13.260 --> 05:17.910
this in this modifier I must select the object that's going to do the cutting here and I'm going to

05:18.360 --> 05:22.110
select the first sphere.

05:22.120 --> 05:25.050
Now there are several different operations that we can use here.

05:25.180 --> 05:26.740
One is intersect.

05:26.740 --> 05:28.410
That's what's happening now.

05:28.690 --> 05:33.630
The intersection between those two objects another is union.

05:34.180 --> 05:41.920
And if we press the Z key to go to wireframe mode we can kind of see what's going on here so it's highlighting

05:41.920 --> 05:50.960
what's going to happen but if we choose difference we can see that we're going to get that piece cut

05:51.050 --> 05:53.190
into the main object.

05:53.450 --> 05:59.030
So I hit the Z key to go back to wireframe and hit apply.

05:59.110 --> 06:08.410
And now if we take that and move it out we can see that we've cut that shape into that object.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.150
OK so that's good.

06:10.150 --> 06:17.200
Now what I want to do is I want to cut this the shape of that so I can go ahead and delete this with

06:17.200 --> 06:17.890
the x key.

06:17.890 --> 06:23.380
I don't need that anymore and I'm going to come over here and hit the period key on the numpad to zoom

06:23.380 --> 06:34.030
in and for this one now I want to select this object and I want to add a boolean modifier to it.

06:34.250 --> 06:42.170
And for the object that's doing the cutting I'm going to choose the cube 001 and Mammon to go wireframe

06:42.170 --> 06:42.540
mode.

06:42.650 --> 06:45.220
So we can kind of see what's happening here.

06:45.230 --> 06:56.500
So this is the Intersect operation this is the union operation and this is the difference.

06:56.510 --> 06:58.590
And that's what we want that.

06:58.610 --> 07:03.450
I just want to cut that piece off so it fits on to here.

07:03.560 --> 07:08.520
So I'll go back to shaded view with the Z key and I'll hit apply.

07:09.390 --> 07:14.540
And now you can see that this one is cut out as well.

07:15.020 --> 07:18.110
All right so I can get rid of this now.

07:19.300 --> 07:27.330
And I can move this one back to the zero point in the x axis.

07:27.380 --> 07:33.260
So now I've got the whole window here cut out and the hole here cut out.

07:33.260 --> 07:43.190
Now the problem is is it's kind of a mess in that we've got this kind of ragged edge with guns here.

07:43.190 --> 07:47.570
In other words polygons that are more than four sides.

07:47.570 --> 07:51.630
We really want quads or tri's.

07:51.710 --> 07:54.320
So there we have that piece cut out for us.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.500
I'm going to go ahead and delete this.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.650
I'm going to press a control tab and click face.

08:01.670 --> 08:05.360
And now I'm going to hit the x key and delete faces.

08:05.390 --> 08:12.260
I'm going to do the same thing over here am to select this one and try and get rid of the faces on this

08:12.320 --> 08:13.610
side.

08:13.630 --> 08:19.970
Now they're kind of a mess but I can press the C key for circle select.

08:19.970 --> 08:27.620
So now I can just click and come through and select faces on this side of the object just kind of click

08:27.620 --> 08:31.530
and drag and start getting rid of these.

08:31.790 --> 08:38.620
I need to right click to get out of the circle tool and then hit X and choose faces.

08:39.490 --> 08:44.400
And that'll begin to get rid of that see how ugly this is and that's fine.

08:46.830 --> 08:50.230
I'm going to need to go through and clean this up a bit.

08:50.280 --> 08:58.860
In addition if you go into vertex mode here you can see that there are these extra vertices hanging

08:58.860 --> 09:01.410
out and those aren't good either.

09:02.370 --> 09:06.970
Usually when you do a Boolean operation there is some cleanup that has to be done.

09:06.990 --> 09:14.670
So if I select these vertices hit the x key and then choose dissolve vertices it should clean those

09:14.670 --> 09:19.520
up so that ends up being a face with four sides.

09:19.590 --> 09:24.230
So if you look at this face down here it's got one.

09:24.390 --> 09:30.210
Well here let me go to edge mode it's got one two three four five sides and that's something you really

09:30.210 --> 09:32.210
want to try and avoid.

09:32.250 --> 09:39.870
So I'm just going to select that see that vertex and click dissolve and I'll just need to go through

09:40.230 --> 09:42.130
and clean this up a bit.

09:42.300 --> 09:49.380
So I've just gone around selecting these stray vertices and once I've done that I'll hit the x key and

09:49.380 --> 09:54.720
click dissolve vertices and that should help clean that up.

09:54.720 --> 10:01.620
In addition I've got a couple here I could maybe merge together so maybe I'll select these two and choose

10:01.710 --> 10:10.610
Allt them and maybe merge these at the center of the two like that.

10:10.740 --> 10:15.250
And one more thing to watch out for our faces like these.

10:15.290 --> 10:24.110
You can see that this one has one two three four five sides to it might not be a problem in the future

10:24.140 --> 10:30.360
but I'm going to go ahead and take these two points and merge them together with him.

10:32.210 --> 10:39.250
And that will collapse that so that we have one face that's a try with three sides and one face that's

10:39.640 --> 10:41.050
four sided.

10:41.050 --> 10:45.050
So you might want to just go through and just make sure that all of those are cleaned up.

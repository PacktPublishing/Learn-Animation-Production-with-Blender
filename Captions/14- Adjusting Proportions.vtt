00:01.040 --> 00:07.940
Before we begin detailing the Mac Let's take a look at creating this one last major piece which is the

00:08.440 --> 00:11.410
backpack jet pack thing.

00:11.480 --> 00:17.580
I think this particular item will affect the look of the Mac enough where we need to do it.

00:17.600 --> 00:24.290
Now we need to rough it in to see how it's going to look and to see what the proportions of it should

00:24.290 --> 00:25.310
be.

00:25.310 --> 00:27.890
I've got the 3-D cursor in the center of the grid here.

00:27.890 --> 00:33.190
I'm going to go to the Create tab and let's just begin with the cube.

00:34.350 --> 00:39.480
And let's just begin putting it in place on the back and seeing

00:43.850 --> 00:46.400
how big it should be how we should scale it.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.530
Things like that.

00:48.590 --> 00:57.700
So I think I'm going to scale it in a bit and I'm just looking at the reference image here.

00:59.670 --> 01:07.830
I think something like that but I think what I'm also going to do is what we did for the main body here.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.770
I'm going to go ahead and add a subdivision surface modifier to it

01:15.750 --> 01:22.450
and maybe give it one more subdivision level.

01:22.690 --> 01:25.180
So we get a few more polygons out of it.

01:26.130 --> 01:34.830
And then when I go into edit mode I'll be able to see the original cage but I think I'll hit this button

01:34.830 --> 01:39.210
here to see the subdivided mash instead.

01:39.630 --> 01:45.280
So now I should be able to come in here and begin moving these around a bit.

01:48.860 --> 01:52.430
To get the shape I'm looking for.

01:54.130 --> 01:59.980
All right so now that I've got it to this shape I'm going to go ahead and turn that edit cage button

02:00.040 --> 02:09.910
off so I can see the low rez version and now I begin adding edge loops with control are here I should

02:09.910 --> 02:15.260
be able to now see it change shape.

02:15.310 --> 02:22.470
I think I want an edge loop in here to flatten it toward the back of the Mac here.

02:23.020 --> 02:25.810
I think I'll select these edges here.

02:27.640 --> 02:38.720
And scale these in a bit and so I'm just using this low poly cage to try and get a general shape to

02:38.720 --> 02:40.950
the object.

02:41.020 --> 02:48.340
So here's the shape I've come up with and it's just kind of a bulbous shape here.

02:48.340 --> 02:55.690
I've tried to flatten the part that goes up against the back of the Mac just a bit with this edge loop

02:55.690 --> 02:56.570
here.

02:56.590 --> 03:02.800
I've also added an edge loop down the middle to allow me to pull these up some to give just a little

03:02.800 --> 03:04.030
bit of an arch.

03:04.040 --> 03:12.060
Now of course this is still early in blocking in and getting the proportions and the scale of the character.

03:12.370 --> 03:15.670
But I think I'll go with this for now.

03:15.670 --> 03:22.000
So in the same way we applied the subdivision surface modifier before to get some extra geometry on

03:22.000 --> 03:23.040
the body here.

03:23.170 --> 03:27.460
I'll do the same thing for the jet pack here.

03:27.460 --> 03:34.690
Yeah I'll go ahead and apply the subdivision at subdivisional level one instead of two at one it'll

03:34.690 --> 03:39.410
give me some good geometry without getting too many polygons in it.

03:39.730 --> 03:47.480
So I'll go to object mode and I'll just come over here to the modifier and just click apply.

03:47.480 --> 03:56.320
So now if we go into edit mode we can see we've got our base geometry for the jet pack here and we can

03:56.320 --> 03:59.200
begin working on the details from there.

03:59.200 --> 04:08.110
So now with the major pieces on the character here I think I would just want to take a look at its general

04:08.110 --> 04:09.130
proportions.

04:09.300 --> 04:13.630
I mean there are other pieces we're going to put on I have in the drawing that we're going to put on

04:14.440 --> 04:23.180
tubes or pipes up here at the top may be jet pack exhaust cylinders down here.

04:23.350 --> 04:28.840
There are going to be other things we're going to do but at this point in time I think it's a good idea

04:28.840 --> 04:34.070
to take a step back and look at the overall design of the character.

04:34.360 --> 04:41.470
And I kind of like what's going on with the body and the size of the legs here.

04:42.890 --> 04:50.040
But I think I'd like to make the hands a little bit bigger I feel like the arms are kind of tiny compared

04:50.040 --> 04:52.030
to the rest of the body.

04:52.080 --> 04:59.010
So let's just work on that for now and try and get that finalized before we move on to the details.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.840
What I'm going to do is select the arms here.

05:01.890 --> 05:07.040
And I'd like to split the hands out from the arms.

05:07.080 --> 05:12.070
So what I'm going to do is just tab into edit mode here and hit a to d select.

05:12.120 --> 05:17.220
So what I'll do is just hover over these pieces and hit the L key.

05:17.220 --> 05:23.780
I'll zoom in a bit and I'm going to continue to just hover over these pieces and hit the L key.

05:23.970 --> 05:29.760
Now that I have these selected let me just make sure I've just got the hand selected.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.730
I want to split the hand out as its own object.

05:32.910 --> 05:39.090
So to do that I'm going to press P and then I'm going to choose separate by selection so that all of

05:39.090 --> 05:43.790
these pieces will be separated out as one individual object.

05:43.830 --> 05:48.730
So I click that and there we have our new geometry.

05:48.840 --> 05:53.370
So I'll come back here and I'll de-select everything and then when I select the hand you can see that

05:53.370 --> 05:57.890
it's its own object and I'll just call this and.

05:57.900 --> 06:03.180
Now let's use this to kind of get a sense of what we might want to do here.

06:03.510 --> 06:09.540
So I'm going to set the origin to the geometry and I'm just going to begin scaling it up and moving

06:09.540 --> 06:10.530
it around.

06:11.010 --> 06:20.380
So I feel like maybe something like this and I'll take a look at it from other points of view.

06:20.390 --> 06:29.960
So I'll hit the one key on the numpad and then the five on the numpad and just see how it looks in front

06:29.960 --> 06:30.840
view.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.030
Hit the three key.

06:32.030 --> 06:38.510
How it looks in the side view from the side view if you like I can almost come down like this.

06:42.130 --> 06:49.240
So I think this is how I want it I think I'd like the hand a little bigger farther down on the body

06:49.240 --> 06:59.050
so it can reach farther than I think it just looks a little more intimidating with the hands being so

06:59.050 --> 07:01.790
big so I think this is what I'm going to try.

07:01.990 --> 07:07.690
Which means now I've got to redo the arm the forearm the elbow and the upper arm but that shouldn't

07:07.720 --> 07:08.540
take too long.

07:08.530 --> 07:10.380
We know how to do that.

07:10.390 --> 07:17.560
So what I want to do is go back to this the arms again and I'll go ahead and apply the mirror bonfire

07:17.620 --> 07:18.880
this time.

07:18.880 --> 07:24.610
And now I'm going to tap into edit mode and select these pieces here almost like this and this and I'm

07:24.610 --> 07:26.600
going to get rid of them for now.

07:27.360 --> 07:31.300
So I'll hit the x key and delete faces.

07:31.490 --> 07:41.670
And I wanted to take this piece now and make it its own object so oppressed peaky and selection.

07:41.730 --> 07:47.980
So now I'd like to place this and try and figure out where the elbow is going to be so I'll set the

07:47.980 --> 07:52.900
origin to the geometry and begin moving this around as well.

07:54.270 --> 07:59.280
And all I'm doing is just trying to get a sense of the size of the arm here.

08:01.120 --> 08:07.650
And once I've got that down then I can recreate the forearm and the upper arm.

08:07.660 --> 08:08.160
All right.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.220
I think I've got it to where I wanted here.

08:12.750 --> 08:16.530
In addition I think I'm going to go ahead and separate out that shoulder joint

08:19.420 --> 08:27.430
so I'll select that with the L key hit the key and separate by selection and I'll take the origin to

08:27.430 --> 08:29.400
geometry.

08:29.620 --> 08:30.070
All right.

08:30.080 --> 08:34.120
So now we've got these pieces here.

08:34.280 --> 08:40.990
I'm going to go ahead and set the origin to the center of the sphere on this one by moving the cursor.

08:43.510 --> 08:47.710
And then moving the origin to the 3D cursor.

08:47.710 --> 08:53.140
Now one thing I haven't mentioned yet is you can take the cursor the 3D cursor back to the center of

08:53.140 --> 09:00.160
the grid and also frame up everything in your scene all in one quick shortcut key and that's shift see

09:01.450 --> 09:05.890
and that will put the cursor in the center of the grid and frame up your scene.

09:06.870 --> 09:13.620
All right so now I've got the where the shoulder elbow and wrist is going to be I just need to recreate

09:13.620 --> 09:15.760
the geometry for the arms.

09:15.840 --> 09:24.720
So what I'm going to do is I will create a circle and use those to recreate the arms.

09:25.290 --> 09:38.330
So I select this one and cursor to selected create a circle give it think we use 12 before didn't we.

09:38.330 --> 09:42.560
And the fill type of nothing we don't want to fill it.

09:42.560 --> 09:47.210
So I scale it down and place it

09:55.300 --> 09:56.800
through the same thing here.

09:57.740 --> 10:04.100
Move the cursor create a circle scale it down

10:08.100 --> 10:10.280
move it up a bit.

10:10.320 --> 10:18.890
Now we can use the same trick we use for the leg to bridge these two circles.

10:19.290 --> 10:24.450
But before I do that I want to arrange them a bit and point them towards each other.

10:24.600 --> 10:30.250
Change the pivot point on this and rotate it around the sphere just a bit.

10:30.270 --> 10:31.460
Something like this

10:35.440 --> 10:44.430
and maybe do the same for this one.

10:44.490 --> 10:46.170
So they're pointing at each other.

10:46.470 --> 10:51.800
And now I'll select these to join them together with control J.

10:53.770 --> 10:55.060
Tab into edit mode

10:58.850 --> 11:07.040
and bridge these together with control E and bridge edge loops now I can go ahead and add some more

11:07.040 --> 11:08.870
geometry here as well.

11:08.870 --> 11:14.420
So I'll increase the number of cuts to go with three.

11:14.950 --> 11:17.420
So we have some edges to work with there.

11:18.010 --> 11:21.560
And if I go to edge mode I can begin selecting these.

11:22.000 --> 11:31.210
Let's put the pivot point back to the median and I can begin scaling these so they look a little the

11:31.210 --> 11:38.340
upper arms look a little beefier.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.660
Now let's do the same thing for the forearm.

11:41.740 --> 11:46.870
I'll select this object snap the cursor to it.

11:47.810 --> 11:57.480
And I'll create a circle scale it down a bit move it up and while I'm here I'll go ahead and point it

11:57.510 --> 12:05.910
toward that elbow joint by changing the pivot point to the 3D cursor and going to rotate and swinging

12:05.910 --> 12:08.790
it around so it points up at the elbow.

12:08.850 --> 12:10.940
I'll do that at the front as well.

12:13.840 --> 12:14.810
Here we go.

12:15.350 --> 12:23.620
Now like that elbow joint move the cursor create a circle scale it

12:27.460 --> 12:29.480
and move that into place as well.

12:31.030 --> 12:38.680
And once again we select the two circles join them together into one object and then bridge the two

12:38.680 --> 12:41.530
with control and bridge.

12:41.530 --> 12:44.990
And once again I'll add a few cuts to it.

12:46.350 --> 12:51.940
Now I can use these edges to beef it up a bit.

12:52.040 --> 12:59.180
Change the median point or the pivot point back to medium and begin scaling these out a bit.

13:03.070 --> 13:04.990
Yeah I like that a little bit better.

13:05.170 --> 13:07.230
And to check that.

13:07.510 --> 13:10.830
Let's go ahead and select all these pieces now.

13:12.980 --> 13:15.600
The shoulder the elbow the arms the hand.

13:15.620 --> 13:16.620
All of these.

13:16.790 --> 13:19.630
Let's join them together with control J.

13:20.570 --> 13:26.060
Let's take the pivot point back to the center of the grid.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.460
And then let's mirror this over.

13:31.460 --> 13:34.290
Let me get rid of this old arm here.

13:37.860 --> 13:44.500
And now it's like this one and mirror it over with the mirror modifier just to see how it looks.

13:46.120 --> 13:53.910
Yeah I think he looks a little beefier a little more intimidating with the larger hands.

13:54.370 --> 14:00.970
So feel free to adjust yours however you like to get kind of the personality or the character that you're

14:00.970 --> 14:01.940
looking for.

14:02.140 --> 14:06.670
But now that I have the proportions down the way I want him I think it's time for us to begin detailing

14:06.670 --> 14:11.800
the character and finishing it off so we can move on with the rest of the scene.

00:00.960 --> 00:04.520
Well at this point I think I'd like to work on the foot.

00:05.100 --> 00:11.410
We're getting to the stage where we need to begin figuring out how tall this guy is going to be.

00:11.410 --> 00:19.090
Now I've brought him above the grid so far about this far.

00:19.410 --> 00:28.540
But let's add the foot and then we may need to move this guy up or down depending on the relationship

00:28.540 --> 00:29.880
with the flat.

00:29.890 --> 00:31.040
So let's work on that.

00:31.060 --> 00:39.730
I think just to block it out first I'm going to create a cube here and scale it down and I want to have

00:39.730 --> 00:46.510
this be just kind of the temporary heel for the foot.

00:47.950 --> 00:54.160
I think I will a couple of things here I think I'm going to change the pivot point from the 3D cursor

00:54.160 --> 00:56.580
to median point.

00:56.740 --> 01:01.530
So now that move manipulator is there in the center of that object.

01:01.780 --> 01:09.760
I'm going to press the three key to go to side view here to the right camera and then press the five

01:09.760 --> 01:12.180
key to go to orthographic view.

01:12.490 --> 01:18.730
And now I'm just going to place this so that this will be maybe the Heagle of the foot and I'll press

01:18.730 --> 01:24.910
shift D and click to duplicate this and move this forward for the toe.

01:25.450 --> 01:25.830
All right.

01:25.830 --> 01:30.140
So let's see what this is going to look like.

01:30.140 --> 01:38.150
So from the side view is this a good size for the foot.

01:38.150 --> 01:39.830
Now it's kind of big.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.260
However it might work.

01:43.260 --> 01:49.030
Let's let's take the rest of this thing and move it up some.

01:49.050 --> 01:57.850
So I'm going to change from local transformation to global I'm going to go into wireframe and I'm going

01:57.850 --> 02:07.210
to press the B key and click and drag to border select this and I'll hit the Z key again to come back

02:07.210 --> 02:08.780
out of wireframe.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.770
And now I think I'm just going to move this up.

02:11.890 --> 02:23.150
Let me go to the front camera and the five four orthographic and let me see how big do I want this

02:26.150 --> 02:29.080
maybe something like that.

02:29.330 --> 02:36.030
Like the foot the lower leg would come down about like that.

02:36.060 --> 02:38.300
Let's take a look at it from the side view here.

02:41.810 --> 02:49.610
Move this forward maybe just a little bit and this is why I've been keeping things fairly rough and

02:49.610 --> 02:56.830
simple here at the beginning is just to be able to move things around like this in case we needed to.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.650
Let me try it a little bit taller.

03:02.170 --> 03:04.840
So I'm thinking something like this.

03:04.990 --> 03:08.830
And of course for the Mac you're building it's completely up to you.

03:08.830 --> 03:17.820
How tall and what the proportions should be and what I want here is kind of a heel piece and a toe.

03:17.860 --> 03:21.260
And I'll put a joint in between here as well.

03:22.280 --> 03:29.990
So now that I've decided on the proportions and size of the foot I think I'll move these over to a new

03:30.050 --> 03:32.390
layer here a third layer.

03:32.510 --> 03:39.260
So I select those objects I'll press the M key and then I'll choose the third layer here and that will

03:39.260 --> 03:41.330
move those over.

03:41.330 --> 03:47.720
Now if I come over and select that layer there they are isolated on their own.

03:47.750 --> 03:58.190
So I come over here to the modifiers panel click add modifier click subdivision surface and if I go

03:58.190 --> 04:05.100
into edit mode with the tab key I can see my original mesh cage here.

04:05.540 --> 04:13.040
And so to get the shape I want and I'm going to begin inserting edge loops so press control are.

04:13.490 --> 04:21.500
And for this I will insert an edge loop by clicking and then I'm going to pull it back toward the heel

04:21.500 --> 04:26.270
of the foot and that gives me a little bit of a rounded edge up here.

04:26.990 --> 04:34.730
Maybe I'll insert an edge or loop down the center here and maybe if I press control tab and good edge

04:34.730 --> 04:41.200
I can slide this edge and bring it out just a bit like this.

04:41.250 --> 04:44.670
Now for this other one let's do the same kind of thing.

04:44.790 --> 04:52.640
I'm going to add the subdivision surface modifier press the tab key hit the A key to de-select.

04:52.650 --> 04:58.420
Now let's work on adding enough resolution to make this the shape that we want.

04:58.670 --> 05:05.130
So press control are and maybe this could use three subdivisions.

05:05.170 --> 05:13.320
Let's see how this works click and then click again and let's add one down the center here.

05:15.960 --> 05:20.320
And for this once again maybe I could select that edge and pull it back a bit.

05:22.420 --> 05:28.740
I just want to add one edge loop here on the side maybe even pull it down a bit.

05:30.270 --> 05:35.140
So the bottom is a little flatter and I'll do that with this one as well.

05:40.090 --> 05:47.470
So now that I have the basic shape that I want and I'm going to apply the modifiers so that I can work

05:47.470 --> 05:49.880
with the resolution that I see here.

05:49.900 --> 05:58.210
So if I selected this and hit the tab key here I'd still see the original cage but if I come over here

05:58.570 --> 06:07.270
and click on this button here I can kind of see how the polygons will be split up if I increase the

06:07.270 --> 06:13.540
view here you can see a little bit more how the polygons would be split up into smaller segments but

06:13.540 --> 06:21.730
I'm going to keep it at one here so I'm going to go to object mode and I'm going to press apply now.

06:21.750 --> 06:29.520
Hit the tab key you can see how it has broken it up into these smaller faces and that's good that's

06:29.520 --> 06:30.900
what we want for this.

06:30.900 --> 06:35.310
I'll do the same thing for this one click apply.

06:35.310 --> 06:40.150
And there we have a little more resolution to the object.

06:40.260 --> 06:48.180
I think I can remove this edge and perhaps this edge and do a little bit better with this.

06:48.210 --> 06:54.960
Now the way to delete edges is once again to hit the x key for delete.

06:54.960 --> 06:59.430
But instead of just hitting edges you need to come down here to dissolve edges.

06:59.430 --> 07:02.220
Because if I just click edges I get that.

07:02.220 --> 07:09.270
And that's not what I want someone to undo that and I'll press X and then dissolve edges allows me to

07:09.270 --> 07:14.680
get rid of those edges while still keeping all the faces.

07:14.700 --> 07:25.180
So now I can select these edges and begin spacing them out so that I get four nicely spaced polygons

07:25.930 --> 07:28.010
for my extrusion here.

07:28.510 --> 07:36.000
So now if I select four this way I'll also select four this way.

07:36.310 --> 07:45.550
So now I've got all of these faces that I can delete to insert my round shape or my cylinder and when

07:45.550 --> 07:54.310
I create that cylinder I'm going to have to create it using four times 4 or 16 sides so I'll hit the

07:54.310 --> 07:57.060
x key and delete faces.

07:57.520 --> 08:04.510
Why don't I move this pivot point into the center of this edge here so I'll go to edge mode and press

08:04.600 --> 08:12.010
alt and select and now move the pivot point with shift s using cursor to selected.

08:12.160 --> 08:19.360
And now when I create that cylinder it'll pop into the center of this object for the 3D cursor is.

08:19.510 --> 08:22.000
So I create a cylinder.

08:22.070 --> 08:23.710
It's kind of big but that's OK.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.160
And we'll change this to what did we say 16.

08:30.340 --> 08:35.100
And we're going to want the cap Phil to be triangle.

08:35.100 --> 08:35.600
All right.

08:35.620 --> 08:47.560
So now if we go to face mode de-selected with the key hit the B key and select all of these faces and

08:47.680 --> 08:51.250
delete them delete faces.

08:51.320 --> 08:58.340
Now we can begin moving this and scaling this so it fits within this object.

08:58.570 --> 09:07.180
I'm going to pull this down here and go to the tools tab and move the origin back to the center of the

09:07.180 --> 09:10.080
geometry we go.

09:10.310 --> 09:18.700
So scale this down and move it down here to where the object is let's maybe go to the side view here

09:19.700 --> 09:22.930
and take a look at placing it well here.

09:24.590 --> 09:33.050
And we go I just need to select this object and shift select the first and press control J to join them

09:33.050 --> 09:34.250
together.

09:34.340 --> 09:38.960
Then when I hit the tab key to go into edit mode.

09:38.960 --> 09:45.500
Now that we can see they're all one object all press control tab and go into edge mode.

09:45.500 --> 09:51.470
Now to connect the two pieces of this object we've selected points and used the merge table with alt

09:51.570 --> 09:56.240
M but let's try something different here let's try to use the bridge tool.

09:56.240 --> 10:00.890
What I'm going to do is all select this edge so it selects the whole thing all the way around and then

10:00.890 --> 10:06.920
I'll press shift alt and select this edge to select that entire edge loop as well.

10:06.920 --> 10:11.690
Now what let's do is let's try the bridge tool under the edges menu.

10:11.750 --> 10:15.970
So going to press control easy to get to the edges menu.

10:17.460 --> 10:26.630
You can also press control f to get to the faces menu or control V to get to the vertices menu.

10:26.640 --> 10:32.110
But let's do control E and then down here is bridge edge loops.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.480
So I'll just click this and see what happens.

10:35.500 --> 10:39.310
And there we go those begin to connect up there.

10:39.370 --> 10:48.400
So now we have our foot here with a round piece that we can extrude out to place the joint or the ankle

10:48.550 --> 10:49.060
into.

00:00.690 --> 00:06.170
Well now that we've got the main bones in place let's go ahead and parent them.

00:06.450 --> 00:10.920
And then also we're going to want to parent the objects to the bones.

00:10.920 --> 00:20.440
So first of all let's begin with say this arm bone here I'm going to select it and go into edit mode

00:21.330 --> 00:28.980
and if I selected this bone and then shift select the main bone here I should be able to press control

00:28.980 --> 00:38.260
P and choose make parent with keep offset and that will now parent that bone.

00:38.260 --> 00:45.970
And therefore this whole chain to the main bone of the body I'll do the same thing down here select

00:45.970 --> 00:53.270
the upper leg bone shift select the main body bone control P and keep offset.

00:53.620 --> 00:58.260
I will select this spotlight bone up here.

01:00.130 --> 01:03.990
And then shifts like the body and press control.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.150
I'll also do that on the other side.

01:15.440 --> 01:19.450
So now they all should be Parenthood to that main bone of the body.

01:19.670 --> 01:27.080
If I tabbed out of that mode and go into pose mode and maybe rotated this you can see that they all

01:27.080 --> 01:28.890
come along.

01:28.940 --> 01:35.760
So now I want to parent these individual objects to each of their corresponding bones.

01:35.990 --> 01:40.250
Now to do that I need to go through a similar process here.

01:40.400 --> 01:47.780
But for this I'm going to make sure that the armature is in PPOs mode and then I'm going to go over

01:47.780 --> 01:49.160
and select that object.

01:49.190 --> 02:00.600
So like say this upper arm shift select that bone and press control P and parent to the bone.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.420
So same thing here.

02:04.090 --> 02:12.990
Select the lower arm shift select that bone control P and bone I'll do that with the body

02:20.390 --> 02:22.830
and on through the whole rig.

02:29.070 --> 02:30.900
I'll begin on the fingers here.

02:30.900 --> 02:34.570
Selecting one joint shift selecting a bone and control P.

02:40.830 --> 02:51.000
one thing that I've noticed as I've been going through this is that if I select this bone and I rotate

02:51.000 --> 02:55.560
it the fingers do not come along.

02:55.570 --> 03:01.380
Same with the bone I appear if I select this bone and rotate it.

03:01.540 --> 03:07.840
The fingers don't come along so I need to parent those fingers to this main hand bone.

03:08.080 --> 03:18.490
So I'm going to go back to edit mode and select this finger and shifts like the hand and then press

03:18.490 --> 03:21.850
control P and keep offset.

03:21.850 --> 03:28.870
Now if I go to pose mode and rotate this now that comes along that's what we want.

03:29.140 --> 03:33.310
So I just forgot to parent the fingers to the hand.

03:33.580 --> 03:36.480
So I'll go ahead and do that.

03:36.490 --> 03:43.240
So now if I go to pose mode and select this lower arm if I hit the Arki to rotate.

03:43.240 --> 03:54.840
Now everything comes along for the ride and lastly I'll need to select this object the spotlight and

03:54.840 --> 04:01.830
shift select that bone and press control P and parent to bone.

04:01.830 --> 04:11.390
So now if I select that bone and I'll press R twice and now I can rotate around like that.

04:11.690 --> 04:19.430
So now we can see if I Slik this main body bone and hit our twice again I can rotate this guy around

04:19.460 --> 04:22.750
and everything comes along and that's what we want.

04:24.700 --> 04:31.720
So the next thing let's do is set up what's called an iCade chain on the legs and I K stands for inverse

04:31.720 --> 04:38.590
kinematics which means that we'll be able to select like the ankle and when we move the ankle around

04:38.590 --> 04:40.950
it will move the entire leg.

04:40.990 --> 04:47.620
So it's kind of like when someone shakes your hand and they move your hand around and your whole arm

04:47.620 --> 04:53.920
at the elbow and shoulder adjusts as the hand is moved around.

04:53.920 --> 05:04.420
So what we need is an I.K. target a target down here near the ankle that the inverse kinematics chain

05:05.020 --> 05:08.570
can use as it's control object.

05:08.650 --> 05:12.800
A good thing to use is just this foot bone here.

05:12.970 --> 05:18.760
So I'm going to select the armature and I'll go into edit mode.

05:19.270 --> 05:20.200
I'll select that.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.930
Let me turn off the axes here.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.870
So there you go.

05:24.880 --> 05:32.830
So to create an I.K. target I'll just select this bone and press shift D and then I'll hit enter and

05:32.830 --> 05:36.090
that will create a new bone there.

05:36.430 --> 05:42.390
If I look in the properties panel and scroll down here I can see that it's been named foot.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.380
Heal l 001.

05:44.530 --> 05:52.750
So that's the copy that's the one we want to rename and I'll call this foot I K Dot else.

05:52.750 --> 05:57.910
And this will be the I.K. target for the left foot here.

05:57.970 --> 06:06.890
Now this foot bone was a child of the lower leg bone and it's also apparent of the toe.

06:07.150 --> 06:08.950
But we need to clear those out.

06:08.950 --> 06:11.230
We need to clear that parenting information out.

06:11.230 --> 06:18.880
So let's press with this new bone selected let's press alt P and let's clear the parent for this bone

06:19.680 --> 06:21.240
we go.

06:21.470 --> 06:21.880
All right.

06:21.890 --> 06:25.210
So now what we need to do is go ahead and create the iCade chain.

06:25.220 --> 06:30.580
So I will go to pose mode and select this lower leg.

06:32.050 --> 06:41.080
And in post mode we get this panel over here this bone constraints panel I select that I can add a bone

06:41.150 --> 06:46.570
constrained and in here I'll choose inverse kinematics.

06:46.570 --> 06:50.050
Now we have a few things that we need to fill in here.

06:50.230 --> 06:53.020
First of all we need to target something.

06:53.170 --> 06:59.500
So to do that I'm going to click in this field and choose the armature first and then the bone within

06:59.500 --> 07:02.170
the armature that we're going to target.

07:02.350 --> 07:10.600
I'm going to type in foot and it'll search for everything with foot in it and I'll choose this foot

07:10.650 --> 07:12.310
I.K..

07:12.610 --> 07:19.030
Now the iCade Shane is going to consist of two bones the lower leg and the upper leg.

07:19.090 --> 07:25.500
So I need to set the chain length to match that so I need to change this to two.

07:26.200 --> 07:34.840
And now if I come back and select that I k target let me click I can click through here and kind of

07:34.840 --> 07:36.010
toggle between two.

07:36.010 --> 07:42.420
So there's the foot heel the original one if I click again I get the foot OK.

07:42.940 --> 07:51.240
Now if I hit the G key and move this around you can see I'm moving the entire leg around which is kind

07:51.240 --> 07:53.000
of cool.

07:53.040 --> 07:53.580
There you go.

07:53.580 --> 07:57.200
There's our robot leg.

07:57.390 --> 07:58.480
All right.

07:58.680 --> 08:03.910
So now as we move this around you can see that click there.

08:03.930 --> 08:11.010
And now you can see that the foot bone isn't following the I.K. target.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.290
So we need to fix that.

08:13.800 --> 08:20.290
So to clear the location of this and get it back to where it was I could just press command Z to do

08:20.640 --> 08:27.180
but I can also press alt G and that will clear the location.

08:27.180 --> 08:34.650
You can also clear the rotation with Allt are and clear the scale with old ass.

08:34.700 --> 08:41.750
So let's constrain that original foot bone or click here again that foot heel bone.

08:41.840 --> 08:45.470
Let's constrain that to the I.K. target.

08:45.860 --> 08:54.170
So I'll add a bone constraint and I'll choose a copy rotation constraint and for the target I'll choose

08:54.170 --> 09:01.830
the armature for the target bone or type in foot and choose that foot.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.280
I.K. bone.

09:04.040 --> 09:13.820
And now if I choose that foot I K should be able to move this around and have that foot bone stay constrained

09:14.690 --> 09:16.400
to the I.K. target.

09:16.400 --> 09:20.110
Now if I move it away away you can see it's going to pull away.

09:20.120 --> 09:25.200
But generally speaking within the range of the leg it should be fine.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.720
Let's go ahead and create an iCade chain over here on this other leg.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.110
So I'll choose the foot.

09:32.150 --> 09:35.570
He'll actually I need to go into edit mode to do that.

09:35.720 --> 09:40.760
So I'll choose this foot heel bone all duplicated

09:43.420 --> 09:49.530
and let's call it foot I K Dot R.

09:50.010 --> 09:59.310
Let's clear any parenting information by pressing alt P and clear parent Nalut switch to pose mode and

09:59.310 --> 10:05.770
select that lower leg bone and let's add a constraint and inverse kinematics.

10:06.270 --> 10:13.680
And for our target we'll choose armature for our target bone type and foot will choose that foot.

10:13.710 --> 10:22.450
ICade our will change the chain length to where we go.

10:22.560 --> 10:30.720
So now if we choose that foot I.K. bone we should be able to move things around but we want to constrain

10:30.930 --> 10:35.010
the foot bone to the I.K. bone.

10:35.310 --> 10:38.640
So I'll select that foot heel.

10:38.730 --> 10:45.880
Our go to our constrains panel Add a bone constraint and let's add that copy rotation again.

10:47.460 --> 10:55.440
We'll choose armature for our target foot iCade are for the bone.

10:55.440 --> 11:05.760
And so now if we choose that I.K. bone we can hit G and move that foot around.

11:05.840 --> 11:06.860
All right.

11:07.010 --> 11:12.070
So we now have I.K. chains for each of the legs.

11:12.380 --> 11:21.320
We should now be able to choose this main body bone and hit G and move him around and he does deep knee

11:21.320 --> 11:22.570
bends.

11:22.640 --> 11:31.450
So we're getting there in the next video we'll take a look at creating a full roll rig for each of the

11:31.450 --> 11:37.870
feet so that we can roll the feet up onto the ball of the foot and back onto its heel.

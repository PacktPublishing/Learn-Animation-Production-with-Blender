Hi I'm Daryn Lyle and welcome to mastering blender and this course will create an animated scene in

00:08.310 --> 00:10.820
Blender from start to finish.

00:10.830 --> 00:15.270
We'll begin by talking about Blender's user interface and navigation tools.

00:15.420 --> 00:19.500
And then we'll jump right in and begin modeling the character in the scene.

00:19.770 --> 00:26.160
Will U-V map and texture the environment and the mech Once that is done we'll work on rigging the mask

00:26.460 --> 00:29.990
and animate it flying into the scene and landing.

00:30.330 --> 00:35.910
We will light the scene and go over the process of rendering the animation and exporting it out to a

00:35.910 --> 00:42.180
movie file creating an animated scene is an amazing process and it's a lot of fun.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.210
So let's get started with mastering Blendr.

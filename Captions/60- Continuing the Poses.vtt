00:01.190 --> 00:07.230
Have the arms What do we need to do with the arms.

00:07.290 --> 00:11.110
I think they need to come down so I'm going to begin.

00:11.130 --> 00:18.120
I'll begin here as well but this time I won't go to the same place so in fact these two what I could

00:18.120 --> 00:19.600
do is I could.

00:19.800 --> 00:20.700
Let me try this.

00:20.700 --> 00:25.230
I'm going to move one a little bit forward like this.

00:25.230 --> 00:26.460
See what happens here.

00:30.910 --> 00:33.990
There I'm seeing a little bit more of a difference.

00:33.990 --> 00:34.350
All right.

00:34.350 --> 00:38.550
I'm going to go ahead and deal with the arms here and move this back a bit.

00:38.550 --> 00:43.530
So with the arms I think they too need to kind of drop a bit.

00:43.560 --> 00:59.280
So at this point maybe this one comes down a hair and then at this point we hear this one maybe drops

00:59.280 --> 01:03.530
like that looks like that's coming out.

01:05.060 --> 01:08.040
Don't want to drop that quite that far.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.550
Something like that.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.080
I don't want a pole.

01:11.360 --> 01:17.030
I don't want to pull this away from the arm and lock the joint like that that's always going to create

01:17.030 --> 01:18.600
some sort of popping.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.990
So I don't want to pull it that far.

01:23.430 --> 01:25.340
All right and take a look at how this looks

01:30.630 --> 01:37.220
too much like I think for several of these let's to the arm.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.550
I'm going to start dragging these back a bit

01:42.390 --> 01:43.850
like this.

01:46.090 --> 01:49.570
Let me try this.

01:49.700 --> 01:50.900
And the foot.

01:51.030 --> 02:10.250
I'll take one of these back and maybe this one back quite a bit here like this is try this.

02:10.310 --> 02:11.890
That's interesting actually.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.490
Where is this foot.

02:14.490 --> 02:16.650
I'm not sold on this yet.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.080
Here it is.

02:18.090 --> 02:20.920
Maybe I'll just rotate it and see how that works.

02:26.140 --> 02:27.460
Yeah that's a little better.

02:30.740 --> 02:38.990
Well move this forward just a bit like this and then try that.

02:39.180 --> 02:39.560
All right.

02:39.570 --> 02:43.240
Let's take a look at this from the camera point of view.

02:45.960 --> 02:54.930
OK I'm going to go back to frame one and I'll come back here to frame maybe 200 and let's watch this

02:54.930 --> 02:55.920
from the beginning.

03:05.060 --> 03:13.250
All right so the next thing I'd like to do is to pose him for that and move forward.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.430
He needs to kind of prepare for it.

03:15.770 --> 03:17.650
And that move happens.

03:17.660 --> 03:23.130
Let's see he drops down and right about I need to key everything.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.940
And then right about there.

03:26.810 --> 03:31.050
Here is where I think everything should begin.

03:31.920 --> 03:41.760
I'm going to go ahead and key these here I'm going to select the arm the arms and I'll go ahead and

03:41.760 --> 03:49.830
get the elbows and feet and knees controls just everything we've been working with so far and I'll hit

03:50.340 --> 03:56.460
it and I'll go ahead and key the location rotation and scale here.

03:56.790 --> 03:59.960
To put keyframes right here.

04:00.570 --> 04:07.440
So that just kind of put a line of keyframes there that can hold that pose from that point.

04:07.470 --> 04:12.000
So now I'm going to go forward a bit and right about here.

04:12.060 --> 04:18.530
I want his full kind of move pose to be in place.

04:18.720 --> 04:29.360
So as he's kind of flying forward and for that I'd kind of like these things to be like this.

04:29.360 --> 04:36.980
Maybe the hands down like that as he's kind of kind of these arms and limbs or maybe dragging a bit.

04:36.980 --> 04:45.740
As he's moving forward something like this so I'm going to move these back a bit and rotate these down.

04:48.110 --> 04:53.100
And this one back hair and rotate down like that

04:56.280 --> 05:02.970
something like that so he looks like those limbs are kind of dragging as he's moving forward.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.220
Let's see if that worked at all.

05:13.110 --> 05:20.700
Yeah something like that so I'm going to take these key frames now and move them forward just a bit.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.040
Looks like we could give them more time to do that.

05:31.140 --> 05:34.940
I don't think I need this keyframe All right.

05:34.940 --> 05:39.710
Actually I'll move these forward and back just to space them out a little bit differently.

05:41.670 --> 05:46.230
So let's see how this works.

05:55.840 --> 06:03.460
All right now let's get him posed up at that point just before he drops so let's say he comes down like

06:03.460 --> 06:04.390
this.

06:05.170 --> 06:07.390
Moves forward.

06:07.390 --> 06:14.740
Now at this point right here he ought to be in a relatively good pose for the drops so he should come

06:14.740 --> 06:18.510
in and prepare to drop right here.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.670
So what was that 165.

06:20.740 --> 06:24.980
168 Well I'm going to say 170.

06:24.980 --> 06:32.120
I'm going to go ahead and go with this and let's try and get a pose here that we want to have him in

06:32.120 --> 06:36.940
at the top of this arc here just before he drops.

06:37.070 --> 06:44.390
But I have to say if this is where we want the POWs to be we're going to have to go back some key that

06:44.390 --> 06:44.870
aren't we.

06:44.870 --> 06:50.960
So yeah maybe back to well let's see if we want him to hold all of this and tell about.

06:50.960 --> 06:51.640
Right.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.090
Here.

06:54.360 --> 07:03.840
So I'm going to go ahead and keep all of these at this point at 155 so I'm going to hit and location

07:03.840 --> 07:05.310
rotation and scale.

07:05.700 --> 07:09.950
So that'll anchor that pose up to that point.

07:10.350 --> 07:17.610
Now and to move up to 170 and begin posing him here and then I'll adjust the keyframes and how quickly

07:17.610 --> 07:20.910
each limb moves into that pose.

07:20.910 --> 07:29.140
So for this I guess he's going to have to move his legs up some isn't he.

07:30.650 --> 07:39.600
And maybe even his feet a bit for that to prepare for that drop.

07:39.600 --> 07:49.150
I'm going to go ahead and turn off this player so I don't see all of the environment.

07:49.560 --> 07:55.900
So maybe he's preparing to drop and those arms are coming forward a bit

07:58.600 --> 08:01.500
and rotating back a bit like this.

08:08.870 --> 08:11.890
Those arms are looking a little too similar.

08:11.890 --> 08:15.590
Let me move one up and one down.

08:19.530 --> 08:19.980
All right.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.430
Let's see how he looks now.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.230
So he's going to come down

08:27.700 --> 08:31.050
forward.

08:31.400 --> 08:31.750
Right.

08:31.750 --> 08:32.880
That's a little too quick.

08:32.890 --> 08:34.790
But we can work on that.

08:35.200 --> 08:39.540
Well I'm going to keep working on this particular pose and get it timed out.

08:39.790 --> 08:43.810
And in the next video we'll work on the drop down to the ground.

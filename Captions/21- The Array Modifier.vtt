00:00.960 --> 00:06.660
Well there are a couple of last details I'd like to add to the Mac here I've got in my drawing I've

00:06.660 --> 00:16.590
got a little hints at a grill on the front and maybe that there's a little panel or something on the

00:16.590 --> 00:18.830
back of the jetpack.

00:18.930 --> 00:25.410
So that's what I'm going to work on now to get this little grill on the front what I'm going to do is

00:25.410 --> 00:28.410
use some existing geometry.

00:28.410 --> 00:37.020
In other words I'm going to select this rim here and I'll hit the division key on the numpad to isolate

00:37.020 --> 00:37.400
it.

00:39.120 --> 00:44.940
And I think what I want to do is grab some of these faces down here because what I want is a kind of

00:44.940 --> 00:55.560
a grill that conforms to the shape of the rim here and to do that I'll go ahead and use its own geometry.

00:55.650 --> 00:59.460
So I'm going to select these faces right down here.

00:59.730 --> 01:01.730
I'm going to go ahead and duplicate them.

01:02.840 --> 01:07.650
And then click and I'll go ahead and move them out away from the object here.

01:07.880 --> 01:14.230
And while I've still got it selected I'm going to press the P key and separate by selection.

01:14.420 --> 01:16.580
And now that is its own object.

01:16.580 --> 01:19.520
So I'll go back to object mode de-select everything.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.450
Select this guy here.

01:22.130 --> 01:29.450
And for now I'm going to turn off or maybe even just get rid of completely the subdivision surface modifier

01:29.510 --> 01:36.020
that's on it so I can see it a little bit better and I'm going to bring everything back with the division

01:36.020 --> 01:38.030
key on the numpad.

01:38.030 --> 01:41.770
And so here is my new object.

01:42.200 --> 01:45.860
I'm going to move the origin to the geometry.

01:46.080 --> 01:49.270
And now I can move it and try and put it in place.

01:49.280 --> 01:56.220
It's generally going to be so I'm thinking that this is going to be down here underneath this piece

01:56.400 --> 01:58.820
like this.

01:58.890 --> 02:04.860
So there are a couple of things I'd like to adjust here with the vertices.

02:04.860 --> 02:10.730
I think I'm going to bring these down and in a bit.

02:10.790 --> 02:13.630
I want these to be straight up and down like this.

02:14.420 --> 02:15.750
Something like that.

02:15.880 --> 02:23.150
And if I wanted to make sure that these were completely vertical I could take these two vertices and

02:23.150 --> 02:28.960
scale them in the X and that will ensure that they're actually vertical here.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.490
Something like that.

02:31.490 --> 02:34.270
Now it also seems to be a little bit curved.

02:34.550 --> 02:36.960
See how it's kind of curved in like that.

02:37.310 --> 02:42.720
I can fix that by going to say vertex mode selecting all.

02:42.830 --> 02:51.620
And once again using the scale tool this time in the Y and just scale so that it all flattens in that

02:51.620 --> 02:55.910
axis they're move it down into place here.

02:55.910 --> 02:59.650
Maybe it's going to be about this far away from the body.

03:02.510 --> 03:09.950
And now I'm going to go into edge mode and select these edges with alt select and then shift alt select

03:10.580 --> 03:16.820
and select all of the edges all the way around and press the key and then I'm going to click and drag

03:16.820 --> 03:21.500
back into the y axis feel like it needs to be a little bit taller.

03:21.500 --> 03:30.320
So I'm just going to select some of these faces on the bottom and just pull down like so and then I'm

03:30.320 --> 03:38.930
going to take these faces here on the front and I think I fi extrude and then click and then scale in

03:39.020 --> 03:45.850
just a bit say in this axis and scale in a bit here as well.

03:46.110 --> 03:47.390
It's not going to be perfect.

03:47.400 --> 03:53.610
I may have to do a little bit of adjusting but I just was trying to get a rim here.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.130
I think I'll need to adjust some edges now.

04:02.220 --> 04:04.050
And maybe a few points.

04:11.590 --> 04:16.890
So that I've got something that I can then extrude in as well.

04:19.820 --> 04:21.980
Something like that.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.230
Now it looks like currently it's smooth.

04:25.280 --> 04:30.550
So I'm going to come over here to the shading area under the Tools tab and just click flat.

04:30.710 --> 04:36.290
So I can see it more in flat shading subdivision surface modifier.

04:37.300 --> 04:38.970
Views up to two.

04:39.280 --> 04:43.550
And now go back to smooth just to see how it looks.

04:43.720 --> 04:49.160
And I think what I'll do is add some edge loops here along the sides

04:53.590 --> 05:04.530
and on the top and bottom as well and drag it up and insert the other and drag it down and maybe lastly

05:04.530 --> 05:10.750
I could insert two edge loops along the rim of it here like that.

05:10.980 --> 05:21.210
And we go what I like to do is put some vents in here so to do that I'm going to bring the cursor here

05:21.270 --> 05:29.200
into the center of this object cursor to selected and I think I'm just going to create a cube it's going

05:29.200 --> 05:31.100
to be huge here but that's ok.

05:33.780 --> 05:35.170
And scale it down.

05:39.740 --> 05:45.450
And I think I just want to make this kind of a slant a little vent type thing.

05:46.440 --> 05:56.590
And I may take an edge here and just drag it out so it looks a little angled like this.

05:56.590 --> 06:06.230
And if I isolate it oh I can do things like delete the face in the back because we won't need that.

06:07.400 --> 06:11.420
And I could also add a subdivision service modifier to this

06:15.580 --> 06:17.700
and see how this is going to look

06:20.910 --> 06:24.270
and maybe just add a couple of edge loops to this as well.

06:35.630 --> 06:37.550
So it looks something like that.

06:37.940 --> 06:41.330
Now what I want to do is I'm going to bring this over here.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.960
And place it up in here like this.

06:46.130 --> 06:53.250
And then what I thought I'd do is use the array modifier to fill in this area here with slats.

06:53.250 --> 07:01.280
We're going to have to do a bit of moving around but at least to create these we could use the array

07:01.700 --> 07:02.730
modifier.

07:03.050 --> 07:10.730
So to do that I'm going to select this piece and come over here to the ADD modifiers area and click

07:10.990 --> 07:11.780
array.

07:12.690 --> 07:15.580
And you can see it adds a one here.

07:15.840 --> 07:25.170
I'm going to scroll down here and I can increase the count here and you can see that it adds to it.

07:26.030 --> 07:29.790
And I can increase the relative offset as well.

07:30.870 --> 07:33.450
So it spreads them out a bit.

07:34.020 --> 07:45.100
So I think I will spread them out a little more think I'll go like this and then add a few more like

07:45.100 --> 07:45.900
that.

07:46.300 --> 07:56.950
So now we've got 15 and now I'm going to go ahead and apply that soon now they become all one piece

07:57.000 --> 07:58.540
on one object.

07:58.540 --> 08:04.960
And so I'll select this one and now I'm just going to do a bit of moving around and move this into place

08:05.500 --> 08:11.980
and then I'm going to select this one and this one with the L key and move these into place and I'll

08:11.980 --> 08:20.020
just do this for all of them just moving them into place two by two here and I'm just hovering over

08:20.020 --> 08:26.920
each one pressing the L key to select and then hitting the A key to the de-select and then doing it

08:26.920 --> 08:34.360
again for the next few.

08:34.380 --> 08:34.890
There we go.

08:34.890 --> 08:39.100
So now we have event on the front of our Meck.

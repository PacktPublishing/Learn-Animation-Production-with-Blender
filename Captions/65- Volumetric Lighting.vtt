00:00.660 --> 00:07.500
For the lighting in our scene I would like to use volumetric lighting and what that means is that we'll

00:07.500 --> 00:12.930
be able to see the cones of light in the scene as they're shining through.

00:12.930 --> 00:17.670
So I've got this light up here shining down to the ceiling.

00:17.670 --> 00:24.870
If I go over to the rendered viewport shading and let that render for a minute we can see that we've

00:24.870 --> 00:27.130
got the light coming down through the ceiling.

00:27.270 --> 00:33.900
We can see the light down here on the floor and we've got a bit of bounce light happening in the room

00:33.900 --> 00:41.970
too but we can't see that cone of light and I'd really like to have that here in the scene so to do

00:41.970 --> 00:44.890
that we need to turn on volumetric lighting.

00:44.980 --> 00:53.460
I'm going to come over here to the world panel and under here I want to go to surface now yours may

00:53.460 --> 00:58.110
say use nodes and if it does go ahead and click on that.

00:58.170 --> 01:03.360
Now if you click on used nodes you'll get a surface of background here.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.110
I'll go ahead and choose that.

01:05.220 --> 01:09.110
Now when I do it it brings in a white color.

01:09.180 --> 01:13.080
Yours may be kind of middle gray and that's fine.

01:13.080 --> 01:17.930
In fact I think I'm going to bring mine down to kind of a middle gray as well.

01:18.330 --> 01:26.400
And then down here in the volume section you need to click on this and select volume scatter and that

01:26.400 --> 01:30.790
will give us our volumetric lighting and you may be asking.

01:30.810 --> 01:32.070
It doesn't look very good.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.550
Well no it doesn't.

01:33.550 --> 01:37.560
We need to take the density down quite a bit.

01:37.650 --> 01:46.680
So instead of 1.0 Let's take it down to point 0 1 and let's see how that looks a little bit better.

01:47.010 --> 01:51.570
Let's also take the ambient occlusion factor to point 0 2.

01:51.570 --> 01:55.710
Let's try that and you may be able to hear the fan in my computer.

01:55.710 --> 01:59.370
Click on now that it's trying to render out the scene.

01:59.430 --> 02:08.070
So now I'm just beginning to see the faintest outline of a light cone here that's the volume of light

02:08.100 --> 02:10.110
that we're trying to go for.

02:10.200 --> 02:18.690
So now it's a matter of adjusting your settings to the way you want it so you can maybe adjust the color

02:18.690 --> 02:21.490
of the background up a bit.

02:21.600 --> 02:27.890
You could take the density of this from point 0 1 maybe to point to.

02:27.960 --> 02:32.500
You could then bring up the ambient occlusion from point 0 to two.

02:32.520 --> 02:32.820
I don't know.

02:32.820 --> 02:36.060
Point five something like that.

02:36.180 --> 02:39.370
And it's kind of a balancing act.

02:39.390 --> 02:45.400
In addition you could go in and increase the intensity of the light itself.

02:45.750 --> 02:52.280
So there's a lot of ways you can do this but ultimately we want some balance of these settings.

02:52.380 --> 02:57.840
That gives us that volume of light coming down through the ceiling.

02:57.870 --> 03:03.510
I'll go ahead and try and increase the strength of the light here I'm going to go ahead and turn this

03:03.600 --> 03:05.280
up just a bit.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.560
See what happens.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.460
So as I said it's a balancing act.

03:10.500 --> 03:15.660
Use these various settings to come up with the effect that you're looking for.

00:00.760 --> 00:06.640
Let's go ahead and begin building our Meck character first of all I think I'd like to just delete all

00:06.640 --> 00:07.900
of these objects out of the scene.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.130
I don't need these.

00:09.160 --> 00:12.070
Ultimately we'll need a camera and lights.

00:12.190 --> 00:17.520
But for now they're just going to get in the way to de-select an object.

00:17.590 --> 00:24.100
You just press the A key and then you press the key again and then you will toggle the selection of

00:24.100 --> 00:25.970
all the objects in the scene.

00:26.020 --> 00:29.560
The key just toggles your selection on and off.

00:29.800 --> 00:35.800
So if you select an object you can de-select the object by pressing the a key.

00:35.830 --> 00:42.180
So I'm going to hit the key then hit the x key to delete and then click delete.

00:43.250 --> 00:46.570
So now we've got a clean scene ready to go here.

00:46.910 --> 00:52.170
Let's take a look at that reference image of the character.

00:52.260 --> 00:56.640
I think what I'll do is begin with this main body piece here.

00:56.640 --> 01:03.150
So the first thing I'll do is go over to the Tools panel over here which you can hide or reveal by pressing

01:03.150 --> 01:11.280
the T key or by clicking this little plus icon here and that will bring up the Tools panel.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.620
I'm going to go to the Create tab and here we've got a list of all the things that we can create in

01:16.620 --> 01:17.430
our scene.

01:17.430 --> 01:19.750
I'm just going to create a basic cube now.

01:21.450 --> 01:30.080
And what I'm going to do is use this basic cube to try and get that shape of the main body of the Mac.

01:30.330 --> 01:35.450
So many use two different modifiers on this as I go.

01:35.490 --> 01:42.750
So I'm going to come over here to the Properties window and this little wrench here is the modifiers

01:42.750 --> 01:50.660
panel and if you click add modifier you get a lot of possible modifiers that you could add to your objects.

01:50.670 --> 01:57.150
The one I'm interested right now is this subdivision surface modifier So if I click on that it will

01:57.360 --> 01:59.700
smooth the object.

01:59.700 --> 02:05.490
Granted it's not real smooth at this point in time but if I increase the view if I increase the number

02:05.490 --> 02:13.110
of subdivisions in the view here you can see that as I do it gets smoother and smoother so I'm going

02:13.110 --> 02:21.960
to want to use this to get that smooth round shape for the body but I'll also want to be able to modify

02:21.960 --> 02:28.560
the object symmetrically So as I edit one side of the object I went the other side of the object to

02:28.560 --> 02:29.730
follow along.

02:29.760 --> 02:33.280
So to do that I want to use the mirror modifier.

02:33.480 --> 02:39.180
But first I'm going to need to delete half of this because of falling a mere half I need to only have

02:39.180 --> 02:40.740
one side.

02:40.770 --> 02:43.960
So what I want to do is split the object in half.

02:44.070 --> 02:50.930
So these buttons here allow you to view the effects of the modifier in the render or in the view here.

02:50.970 --> 02:59.220
Now if I look at the cube here in Object mode and go to hit that by hitting the tab key I can see that

03:00.270 --> 03:02.700
there are no edges in here.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.070
I need to split this in half.

03:05.070 --> 03:12.360
So what I'm going to do is just press control our hover over the cube click once and click one more

03:12.360 --> 03:14.070
time to confirm that.

03:14.190 --> 03:17.490
And that places an edge right down the center of the cube.

03:17.850 --> 03:21.750
So now I can press control tab and go into face mode.

03:22.260 --> 03:28.960
And now I want to select one side of this and delete it so I can mirror it over.

03:29.340 --> 03:36.730
So to select all of these faces I could just select and press shift and keep clicking here.

03:38.900 --> 03:45.380
Like so another way to do that I'm going to press the A key to de-selected those.

03:45.380 --> 03:51.810
Another way to do that is to press the Z key to go into wireframe.

03:51.990 --> 03:59.550
And now I can border select all of these if I press the Beaky I get this kind of here and I can click

03:59.550 --> 04:06.560
and drag and it will create a border selection and now we'll select all those faces.

04:06.570 --> 04:12.240
So now press the Z key again to go back to shaded view here.

04:12.360 --> 04:17.910
Now I can press the x key and delete faces.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.940
All right.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.260
So I'm gonna hit the tab key to go back to object mode.

04:22.570 --> 04:31.740
And now if I turn my subdivision services modifier back on you can see I have this now.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.570
All right so now I'm going to create a mirror modifier for this.

04:35.570 --> 04:43.160
I'm going to click add modifier and go to a mirror and you can see that it doesn't do anything.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.570
Why doesn't it do anything.

04:44.870 --> 04:51.100
Well it's because the axis is set to the x axis here if I turn that off and turn on y.

04:51.320 --> 04:55.790
You can see it Meir's it over in the y axis.

04:55.790 --> 05:04.090
Now I don't really want that I want it to mirror in the x axis cause as we model and rig our character

05:04.880 --> 05:13.640
ultimately when we mirror the rig over when we do constraints and everything like that we're going to

05:13.640 --> 05:20.120
want the character to be facing us with the arms out toward the x axis.

05:20.270 --> 05:27.950
So I need to actually turn this 90 degrees I actually inserted the edge loop in the wrong place but

05:27.950 --> 05:29.310
that's an easy fix.

05:29.330 --> 05:37.490
We can press the end key to go to the properties panel here and in the rotation fields we can rotate

05:37.490 --> 05:47.720
90 degrees around the z axis so I can actually click and drag in here and rotate around the z axis so

05:47.720 --> 05:52.740
I want it actually 90 I want it to be negative 90 here.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.680
Now you may have it correct.

05:55.700 --> 06:02.510
You may already have it the way it needs to be but I need to do this to get it to where it's oriented

06:02.510 --> 06:04.890
in the proper direction.

06:05.060 --> 06:11.960
So I'm going to go ahead and delete the mere modifier for the time being and then I need to apply the

06:11.960 --> 06:12.990
rotations here.

06:13.000 --> 06:22.850
I need to have this be zeros so that the local axis of the object matches the global or the world axis

06:23.150 --> 06:24.210
of Arsene.

06:24.530 --> 06:33.950
So to do that I'm going to press control a and apply the rotation and notice there it zeroes out the

06:33.950 --> 06:36.130
rotation in the z axis.

06:36.140 --> 06:40.080
Now when I come back and add that mirror modifier again.

06:40.430 --> 06:47.080
And now with the x axis selected you can see that it's mirroring over in the correct direction.

06:47.510 --> 06:55.070
All right so they closed the properties panel and in the subdivisions going to increase that to say

06:55.100 --> 06:57.050
to here.

06:57.080 --> 07:06.440
So now if I press the tab key I can go into edit mode and you can see here that it's got both the smoothed

07:06.860 --> 07:10.790
mesh and kind of a ghost image of the original.

07:10.790 --> 07:17.000
So what I'm going to do is come over here to the subdivision surfaces modifier and just click this or

07:17.020 --> 07:27.110
just edit cage button and that will then allow me to see the points directly on the object itself.

07:27.110 --> 07:33.590
Now you can see when I click to select these this manipulator tool is still out here where the original

07:33.590 --> 07:37.180
one would be and that's fine for now.

07:37.610 --> 07:43.960
So now we can begin selecting these points and moving them around and modifying the shape of our object.

07:44.270 --> 07:49.050
But if I click on this point and I move it say the x axis look what happens.

07:51.130 --> 07:57.040
It actually breaks apart to undo that with control or command Z here.

07:57.810 --> 08:04.260
So to keep the pieces from splitting apart down the middle I can come over here to the mirror modifiers

08:04.260 --> 08:07.610
tab and turn on clipping right here.

08:07.620 --> 08:14.820
So now if I select that point and move it around you can see it only moves up and down and it it doesn't

08:14.820 --> 08:17.320
split out from the other side.

08:19.290 --> 08:26.070
All right I'm going to begin modifying this to try and make that basic shape of the of the character

08:26.070 --> 08:26.630
here.

08:26.970 --> 08:34.560
So to do that I'll go to face mode and I'll begin just dragging these around to try and get a basic

08:35.280 --> 08:43.020
shape here and I may need to add some edge loops as I as I go here so I'll hit control r and add an

08:43.020 --> 08:51.880
edge loop down the center here and that allows me to select this edge and maybe move it out a bit and

08:51.880 --> 09:05.470
I'm just switching from face mode to edge mode and just trying to get the shape that I want nuff I want

09:05.470 --> 09:10.020
to just like this whole edge around here instead of just one edge.

09:10.020 --> 09:18.990
I can press Allt and then click and select that edge and that will select that entire loop of edges

09:19.080 --> 09:20.820
around the object.

09:20.820 --> 09:27.210
Now I can move that whole thing up or down here and I'm just trying to do this with as few faces and

09:27.210 --> 09:28.540
edges as I can.

09:28.560 --> 09:36.670
At this point in time just to get the basic shape enough I go back to object mode and increase the views

09:36.670 --> 09:37.320
here.

09:37.330 --> 09:46.480
You can see I'm beginning to get kind of a rounded shape here with kind of as few edges as I can because

09:46.480 --> 09:51.060
the more geometry I put on this the harder it's going to be to manipulate.

09:53.180 --> 10:00.550
All right so there is the basic shape so far of the main body portion.

10:00.590 --> 10:06.410
So in the next video I'll begin creating the other pieces of the MC.

10:06.410 --> 10:09.590
The front glass piece and maybe the arms.

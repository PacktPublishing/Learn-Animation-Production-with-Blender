00:00.900 --> 00:08.670
Now we should look at the role and goals of our bones and make sure that the bones are going to rotate

00:08.670 --> 00:10.850
in a consistent way.

00:11.100 --> 00:19.120
So if we take a look at say this bone here the lower arm bone what we can do.

00:19.120 --> 00:27.370
Let me zoom in here is we can look at the axes that it's going to rotate on by coming over here to the

00:27.670 --> 00:28.740
armature panel.

00:29.020 --> 00:35.410
And let's click on axes and now we get this white access here.

00:35.410 --> 00:45.940
When we're in edit mode and what I want to do is rotate around the x axis with the main bend say the

00:45.940 --> 00:51.900
main bend of this bone is going to be this way with the main bend toward the Z-axis.

00:51.910 --> 01:00.160
So this one actually looks pretty good because we've got the x axis going to this side and the Z axis

01:00.160 --> 01:01.650
facing forward.

01:01.660 --> 01:12.040
So if I went to pose mode here and change my rotation mode to local and went to rotate you can see that

01:12.040 --> 01:20.890
it would rotate around the x axis in the positive direction when it's moving when it's bending you can

01:20.890 --> 01:23.070
see the x is here positive.

01:23.080 --> 01:29.560
Now if I bent it back the other way like that we'd go into the negative here.

01:29.680 --> 01:41.440
So I want to be able to rotate in the x axis with the main bend moving toward the z axis or toward the

01:41.440 --> 01:44.340
positive x.

01:44.350 --> 01:47.640
So let's take a look at this one up here.

01:48.160 --> 01:59.240
I think this is a good angle here that we're rotating in the X going back and forth and that looks good.

01:59.260 --> 02:06.550
However I'd like the positive x to be this way because if we bend it forward you can see it's going

02:06.550 --> 02:10.720
into the negative numbers and I don't want that.

02:10.720 --> 02:17.780
So what I need to do is rotate this axis around 180 degrees.

02:17.780 --> 02:22.020
So I'll come back here to edit mode.

02:22.550 --> 02:29.810
And with that bone selected I'll use the roll field over here in the properties panel and I'll just

02:29.810 --> 02:38.670
click and then drag and I'll roll that around and I can take it around 180 degrees.

02:38.700 --> 02:47.480
So now we go back to pose mode now you can see that we're still rotating in the X-axis But when we move

02:47.930 --> 02:53.740
the arm forward we go in the positive x All right.

02:53.960 --> 02:59.550
Let's take a look at the legs when they zoom in down here.

02:59.600 --> 03:06.430
Now I would say the positive or the main axis of rotation maybe back.

03:06.800 --> 03:12.830
And this decision is kind of arbitrary but I'm going to say that this would be should be positive going

03:12.830 --> 03:14.930
this way and negative going this way.

03:14.930 --> 03:21.770
You may certainly disagree and that's fine for this once again.

03:21.770 --> 03:28.320
Also I'd say this should be positive and this should be negative this.

03:28.360 --> 03:33.270
I think if this is positive like this that doesn't hurt anything.

03:34.280 --> 03:40.420
And if this rotates around the X and positive goes up that's fine too.

03:40.430 --> 03:46.450
So I think the legs are fine the fingers are going to be a different challenge here.

03:46.940 --> 03:51.020
Let's take a look at say the index finger.

03:51.900 --> 03:57.900
Notice that the X is going this way we don't really want it to bend side to side.

03:57.900 --> 04:00.550
We wanted to bend forward and back.

04:00.930 --> 04:05.480
So I will tab into edit mode and take a look at this.

04:05.490 --> 04:16.140
Currently the X is facing up what we should probably do is have the X face side to side and the Z face

04:16.140 --> 04:17.270
down.

04:17.320 --> 04:25.490
So click this on the roll in drag and let's move this.

04:25.810 --> 04:30.380
Let's try and line it up with the angle of the finger here.

04:31.620 --> 04:32.870
Like that

04:35.930 --> 04:38.340
and how was this one doing this one

04:41.070 --> 04:48.100
needs to go the other way so it needs to have the Z facing down so I'll click and rotate that.

04:48.230 --> 04:50.080
So the z is facing down

04:53.620 --> 04:55.480
and this one

04:58.970 --> 05:03.650
will try and line that up so the Z's facing down as well.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.280
So.

05:09.370 --> 05:19.230
All right so now if we go back to pose mode we can select a finger and you see that it rolls in the

05:19.230 --> 05:26.070
X and when we bend it down like that it's positive and up like that is negative and that's good.

05:26.070 --> 05:27.480
That's what we want.

05:27.690 --> 05:33.270
So I need to go through and do the same thing with all these other fingers before we try and mirror

05:33.720 --> 05:37.240
this arm and leg over to the other side.

05:38.010 --> 05:39.580
Let's try and line this one up

05:42.510 --> 05:45.150
so the Z needs to go down.

05:46.100 --> 05:53.020
Like that roll this one.

05:53.090 --> 05:54.540
So the z is down.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.880
And finally this one here.

05:58.990 --> 06:00.320
Roll that one as well.

06:01.660 --> 06:02.190
All right.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.760
So we have our fingers all rotated properly.

06:06.060 --> 06:08.470
I'll go back to object mode here.

06:08.850 --> 06:18.610
And let me make sure we have everything in place before we begin mirroring.

06:18.640 --> 06:19.930
I'll turn off the axes.

06:19.930 --> 06:22.650
We don't need those right now.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.830
How about names.

06:23.830 --> 06:25.550
I me make sure ah.

06:25.750 --> 06:29.770
I need to go through and name all of these finger bones.

06:29.860 --> 06:32.550
So let me do that.

06:32.620 --> 06:35.650
All right I've gone ahead and named these.

06:35.860 --> 06:40.930
Now what I need to do is duplicate and mirror them over to the other side.

06:41.080 --> 06:47.860
When to close the properties panel here and over here in the armature panel I'm going to turn on names.

06:47.980 --> 06:54.130
Now we can see all the names in the viewport of our bones to mirror these over.

06:54.130 --> 07:02.180
I need to select a joint chain duplicated and then mirror it over around the center point.

07:02.220 --> 07:15.000
So if I select the leg bones here in and then if I change my pivot point from median to 3D cursor and

07:15.000 --> 07:19.050
move that 3D cursor into the center of the grid.

07:19.050 --> 07:24.810
Now the pivot point of those selected items is in the center of the grid and we're going to mirror around

07:24.810 --> 07:26.030
that point.

07:26.520 --> 07:32.340
So I'll press shift d to duplicate and I'll immediately press the enter key.

07:32.340 --> 07:40.620
Now notice that the names of the bones are just leg low dot l at 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1.

07:40.620 --> 07:49.440
We need to switch the names from DOT L to dot R. and Blendr has a nice little tool to do that with everything

07:49.450 --> 07:50.590
still selected.

07:50.610 --> 07:59.380
I'm going to press the W key and bring up the specials menu and here in the menu is Phlip names.

07:59.400 --> 08:06.220
So if I select that it will automatically flip the name is from DOT l r.

08:06.270 --> 08:07.090
That's pretty handy.

08:07.090 --> 08:12.470
So now we can mirror these over using control him.

08:13.050 --> 08:19.050
And I'm going to press the access in which we're going to mirror which will be the x axis and then I

08:19.050 --> 08:23.590
have to press the enter or return key and there we go.

08:23.590 --> 08:29.020
Now we've got our chain mirrored and the names flipped.

08:29.020 --> 08:29.350
All right.

08:29.350 --> 08:30.910
Let's do that again.

08:31.210 --> 08:37.720
I'm going hit the Z key to go into wireframe and I'm going to press control and click and drag a selection

08:37.720 --> 08:40.720
around all of these.

08:40.930 --> 08:46.400
And now I'm going to hit the Z key to come back into solid mode here.

08:46.690 --> 08:54.490
And it looks like I've got them all selected and since my pivot point is it 3D cursor and the 3D cursor

08:54.490 --> 08:56.300
is at the center of the grid.

08:56.680 --> 09:00.640
It will pivot or mirror around the center of the grid.

09:00.640 --> 09:10.880
So now what I need to do is press shift D and press Enter press w click flip names.

09:10.910 --> 09:17.360
Now press control em press the x key and hit enter.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.170
So there you go.

09:18.170 --> 09:23.490
We've got our joints mirrored over we've got all the names labeled correctly.

09:23.870 --> 09:24.830
We're looking pretty good.

09:24.830 --> 09:28.920
It looks like I need to name this bone up here for the spotlight.

09:29.270 --> 09:35.510
But other than that I think we're ready to begin creating the control rig that will actually use to

09:35.510 --> 09:36.880
animate the armature.

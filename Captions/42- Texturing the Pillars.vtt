WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:06.850
To create the textures for the pillars I think we need to go through just a slightly different process.

00:06.870 --> 00:14.160
I'm going to go back to that U-V editing lay out now and and isolate the floor and select one of the

00:14.160 --> 00:19.420
pillars here I'll just select this one and I'll isolate it.

00:19.440 --> 00:25.650
Now if I go into edit mode and select everything we can see the U.V. map here.

00:26.660 --> 00:33.130
What am I to do is I'm going to take this U-V map in and use it as a template to lay the texture on

00:33.150 --> 00:41.450
to the islands in GIMP and then I'll save that image out and bring it back to here because whatever

00:41.450 --> 00:46.660
we place over these U-V islands will be seen on our object.

00:46.910 --> 00:52.550
Whereas whatever is outside of these U-V islands won't be seen at all.

00:52.550 --> 00:59.740
So to export a U.V. map out of Blendr I'm going to in the U-V editor here I'm going to press the key

00:59.740 --> 01:04.910
and select everything and then I'm going to go to use these and then peer at the top of the menu I'm

01:04.910 --> 01:08.570
going to choose export U-V lay out.

01:08.570 --> 01:12.380
Now I'm going to export this out into my images folder.

01:12.830 --> 01:14.060
I'll give it a name here.

01:14.060 --> 01:18.930
I'll call this pillars Uvas.

01:19.280 --> 01:25.700
And for the size of the image I'm going to go ahead and change this from 10:24 to 2048

01:28.370 --> 01:32.720
and are image textures usually need to be in powers of two.

01:32.720 --> 01:39.270
So 256 512 10:24 2048.

01:39.500 --> 01:46.940
And since the rendered image I'm planning on rendering this out at 12 80 by 720 which is the lower end

01:46.940 --> 01:54.680
of the HD resolutions it's a good resolution for Internet video streaming.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.620
Things like that.

01:55.910 --> 02:04.100
But since it's going to be 12 80 by 720 and those pillars may at one point in time at the end to be

02:04.130 --> 02:13.650
as high as the frame I'm going to go ahead and go with 2048 just to be safe so I'll click export.

02:13.830 --> 02:14.790
And there we go.

02:15.150 --> 02:19.560
So let's go into Gimp and take a look at that here in Gimp.

02:19.560 --> 02:25.230
I'll go to File Open and I'll choose my Pillar's Uvas

02:27.820 --> 02:36.450
and you can see here it's got this kind of translucent image of the UVA's here so that anything we put

02:36.600 --> 02:42.780
in a layer under neath here is going to show through and we can see whether or not it's going to be

02:42.840 --> 02:45.650
within the U-V islands or not.

02:45.650 --> 02:51.440
I'm going to use that same sandstone texture that we used for the other objects.

02:51.630 --> 02:59.510
So I'll go find that and what I want is the sandstones seamless Riego.

02:59.570 --> 03:07.580
So here are press control or command a to select everything press control or command C to copy and then

03:07.580 --> 03:14.620
I'll come back to my Uvas document and press control or command V to paste.

03:14.630 --> 03:16.420
Now it's going to be kind of big.

03:16.730 --> 03:22.800
So I'm going to zoom out a bit with the minus key.

03:23.050 --> 03:28.420
Now that this has been pasted in I've got this floating selection layer over here and I can't really

03:28.420 --> 03:35.660
do anything until I make this an actual new layer so I'll just come over here and click new layer and

03:35.660 --> 03:39.760
that will create a new layer with that pasted in.

03:40.190 --> 03:47.370
So now if I zoom out with the minus key you can see the frame of the new pasted layer.

03:47.540 --> 03:48.650
But it's a little big.

03:48.710 --> 03:51.670
So I'm going to come over here to the scale tool right here.

03:53.210 --> 04:02.630
And then click and now I have access to this scale tool that will allow me to click and drag and reduce

04:02.630 --> 04:08.230
the size of this namak click scale.

04:08.230 --> 04:17.980
Now you can see it in front of the click the move tool here and move it around so you can see it there.

04:18.010 --> 04:21.220
Now I really want to see the movies in front of this.

04:21.210 --> 04:26.680
I'm just going to take this layer and drag it down below the Uvas.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.080
Now I can see it.

04:28.090 --> 04:31.430
I'm going to press shift plus to zoom in a bit.

04:31.630 --> 04:39.900
I'm going to drag this and place it right over the pillar and I'll scale it a bit more.

04:40.910 --> 04:48.590
And click and drag this out so it fits over the whole pillar.

04:50.330 --> 04:51.310
And hit enter.

04:52.920 --> 04:53.710
There we go.

04:53.850 --> 04:57.210
So that will overlay our pillar.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.660
Now for these pieces up here I think I want it to be a little smaller.

05:00.750 --> 05:05.130
I'm going to duplicate this layer here with this button here.

05:06.340 --> 05:12.170
And then I'm going to select that and I'm going to pull this up go to the move tool and pull this up

05:13.290 --> 05:15.380
there a bit.

05:15.550 --> 05:20.680
I'm going to press the spacebar to move up a bit so I can see this.

05:20.830 --> 05:32.890
So select that layer go to this scale tool and click drag this so it's a little bit smaller like so

05:34.450 --> 05:41.830
and then move it down over these like that.

05:42.060 --> 05:49.570
All right now what I'd like to do is put some sort of imagery some sort of Egyptian hieroglyphics and

05:49.570 --> 05:58.970
I have some of that but I found out on the internet I'll go to File Open and I've got an Egyptian painting

05:59.150 --> 06:00.580
file here.

06:00.580 --> 06:08.750
I'll open that up or press command a and then command C to copy and then come back over here to the

06:09.200 --> 06:15.350
pillar press command V to paste and there it is.

06:15.350 --> 06:23.450
Now it's up here at the top so I'm going to press a new layer to create a new layer from that.

06:23.450 --> 06:29.100
Now I can go to my move tool here and move it around and move this down.

06:29.120 --> 06:36.060
So it is kind of over the main part of the pillar here and I'll scale it

06:40.530 --> 06:41.960
down like this.

06:43.940 --> 06:48.150
Hit enter to apply.

06:48.210 --> 06:56.210
Now I need to pull it down below the pillar you use just to make sure I can see where it is and we go

06:58.440 --> 06:59.010
now.

06:59.090 --> 07:04.930
It's got quite a different color than the pillar it doesn't look like it's part of the rock.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.070
So I think what I'll do is I'll change the blending mode a bit.

07:08.090 --> 07:13.310
I'll come up here to normal and maybe try let's try overlay

07:16.530 --> 07:17.970
and that's not bad.

07:18.910 --> 07:21.100
Now multiply Let's try and multiply

07:24.040 --> 07:25.440
that's a little too dark.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.330
I'll go back to overlay.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.610
And let's bring down the opacity.

07:32.620 --> 07:37.730
Here I'm going to click and drag the opacity.

07:37.910 --> 07:42.150
That's looking a little bit more like it's actually part of the stone now.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.400
Something like that.

07:45.410 --> 07:51.680
Now what I'd like to do is kind of fade the edges into the rest of the pillar here.

07:51.980 --> 08:00.760
So what I can do is come over here to the erase brush and maybe turn the opacity down some and let's

08:01.150 --> 08:03.480
increase the size of the brush.

08:05.140 --> 08:14.350
And I'll just come through here and just click and drag and try and blend that into the rest of the

08:14.350 --> 08:15.390
pillar here.

08:15.470 --> 08:17.580
I'll do this here on the bottom as well.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.880
We'll see if that blends in.

08:21.180 --> 08:21.720
All right.

08:21.750 --> 08:27.220
I think we're ready to export this out and at least see how it's going to look.

08:27.430 --> 08:38.890
We save this first and then I'll go to a file export as and I'll put this in my textures folder and

08:38.890 --> 08:45.850
I'll call it Pillar's color I think is good and I'll export.

08:45.890 --> 08:54.530
All right let's go back to blender now here in Blender what we need to do as we've done before is bring

08:55.530 --> 09:00.470
that image texture here into our note.

09:01.050 --> 09:10.030
So I'm going to press shift a and I'll bring in a texture coordinate node First of all and then I'll

09:10.030 --> 09:14.710
press shift day and go to texture and bring in an image texture.

09:17.080 --> 09:22.910
And I'll open that file in the textures folder here.

09:23.110 --> 09:30.210
Go to Pillar's color and click open and there we have our image.

09:30.210 --> 09:33.030
Now there is a problem.

09:33.330 --> 09:38.300
You can see the Uvas on the image.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.040
Why is that.

09:39.040 --> 09:42.070
Well it's because I forgot to turn them off.

09:42.250 --> 09:45.460
So let's go back to Gamp and do that.

09:45.490 --> 09:51.900
So here in GIMP this layer here is the U-V wires you can see them here.

09:51.910 --> 09:57.190
If I turn this layer off turn the visibility of the layer off.

09:57.440 --> 10:03.000
Then we just get this and that is what we want.

10:03.030 --> 10:11.700
I'm going to click on zoom in here when I click on the open icon here the open image reast select that

10:11.700 --> 10:14.440
pillars and open that again.

10:14.610 --> 10:16.260
And there we go.

10:16.260 --> 10:24.450
I'll go ahead and hook up the U-V coordinates and the color to the diffuse Shater.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.640
And there we go there's our column.

10:26.670 --> 10:29.170
And you can see the seams back here.

10:29.280 --> 10:29.640
Right.

10:29.640 --> 10:37.310
Remember we made sure that the seams were pointing away from the camera and that's why we did that but

10:37.400 --> 10:39.870
other than that it looks pretty good.

10:40.130 --> 10:42.640
So we could also bring in a bump map.

10:42.640 --> 10:46.540
But another way to do that instead of going back to Gimp.

10:46.730 --> 10:54.470
Well we can do is we can duplicate this image texture node with shift D and move it aside here.

10:54.980 --> 11:02.370
And then of course we can create that same bump map node right here.

11:02.550 --> 11:10.890
But what we can also do I'm going to change the color to non-color data but in addition we could use

11:10.890 --> 11:18.600
a converter node the R.G. be too black and white put that right in here.

11:19.540 --> 11:27.820
That will convert it to black and white then take that to the bump node and then from that to the material

11:27.820 --> 11:28.820
output.

11:29.320 --> 11:34.380
So just another way to create a black and white image that we can use.

11:34.470 --> 11:37.980
All right let's go back to our main default view here.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.430
And there we have our pillars.

11:42.430 --> 11:44.600
But notice what happened.

11:44.860 --> 11:50.610
We also have that same texture on our beams and that's not exactly what we want.

11:50.770 --> 11:58.060
That's because when I created the material I created a material for the pillars and the beams and that

11:58.060 --> 12:02.830
was just to temporarily get some color on the objects.

12:03.370 --> 12:12.930
So what I can do is choose one of these beams create a new material slot create a new material call

12:12.930 --> 12:24.170
it beams I'll change the old one to just pillars and I'll get rid of the pillars material for the beam

12:24.220 --> 12:25.060
objects.

12:26.750 --> 12:27.240
Here we go.

12:27.240 --> 12:31.280
So now I can select the various beams here.

12:34.910 --> 12:45.350
And then finally select the beam with the new material and then press control L and materials and that

12:45.350 --> 12:48.800
will assign that material to all those other beams.

12:48.800 --> 12:53.110
So now we've got our pillars with the proper material.

12:53.180 --> 12:56.610
However take a look at the pillars the pillar caps here.

12:57.530 --> 13:00.870
They too still have that same material.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.210
So I select one of those.

13:02.210 --> 13:08.860
And once again add a new material call this polar caps.

13:08.860 --> 13:20.500
Remove the pillar material select all of these Schiff's select that one last and then control L. and

13:20.500 --> 13:26.290
materials and that assigns that to all those other polar caps.

13:26.450 --> 13:33.020
All right we've got our pillars set up in the next video we'll keep going on the textures for the rest

13:33.020 --> 13:33.890
of our objects.

00:00.610 --> 00:06.970
All right we've got the body and the cockpit and the jet pack U-V mapped so far.

00:07.420 --> 00:09.790
Let's work on the arms and the legs.

00:09.790 --> 00:17.770
If I select an arm here you can see that it's mirrored over what I think we should do is go ahead and

00:17.770 --> 00:23.830
delete this a mere modifier and let's just work on one side for now.

00:23.830 --> 00:29.320
So with that selected I will go to the U-V editing lay out.

00:29.500 --> 00:35.300
I will isolate it frame it up and I'll go into edit mode.

00:35.350 --> 00:42.080
And what I'm going to do is hover over this piece and press the key and then I'll press shift.

00:42.100 --> 00:46.860
H to hide everything else and then I can frame this up right here.

00:46.930 --> 00:55.120
So I think I just need to select this one edge and create a seam for this and then select everything

00:55.120 --> 01:00.580
here and press you and unwrap and that's not too bad.

01:00.650 --> 01:03.290
Let me add checker pattern to it.

01:04.110 --> 01:05.530
Yeah that's pretty good.

01:05.700 --> 01:09.330
So I'll press alt h to bring everything back.

01:09.420 --> 01:18.570
Let's select this one here with the key press shift h to hide it all the unselected and then I'll come

01:18.570 --> 01:32.480
back in here and maybe I'll take this edge here and create a seam and then unwrap this.

01:32.580 --> 01:35.120
All right let's try conformal.

01:35.130 --> 01:36.590
Let's see what happens here.

01:37.770 --> 01:40.600
Yeah that's a little better I think.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.030
And I'll work on the legs here.

01:43.030 --> 01:48.780
Now the legs I think as well have a mere modifier on them still.

01:48.890 --> 01:53.920
Well go ahead and turn that off and just work on one side for now.

01:54.160 --> 02:06.060
So I will go into the U-V editing screen lay out isolate it like this edge and Mark ISim and then I

02:06.060 --> 02:11.850
can press the L key to selected you and unwrap.

02:11.850 --> 02:19.630
Now this one looks a little odd so maybe I'll switch it to conformal Let's see how that works.

02:19.700 --> 02:23.150
No it looks a little strange.

02:23.150 --> 02:25.100
Let's add a checker pattern to it.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.210
Yeah that looks very strange.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.050
Let's check if we need to apply the scale.

02:31.230 --> 02:34.590
So press in and it looks like we could.

02:34.620 --> 02:41.680
Let's try it with a press control a and apply the scale and then I'm going to come back into here.

02:41.970 --> 02:46.460
Select that one press you and unwrap.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.770
That looks quite a bit better.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.090
All right let's try the one down here.

02:52.530 --> 03:00.050
I will create a seam on the inside of the leg and then select this with the L key.

03:00.120 --> 03:05.630
You and unwrap and that looks pretty good.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.000
And then the feet down here.

03:10.050 --> 03:12.740
Let's select this edge.

03:12.990 --> 03:15.710
Or maybe there's another edge in here I can select

03:18.850 --> 03:28.360
there's one there so I'll go ahead and Marcus seem in there and maybe I'll split out the bottom of the

03:28.720 --> 03:29.960
heel here.

03:30.670 --> 03:36.100
I like this control easy and Mark seam and let's see how that works.

03:36.110 --> 03:36.690
I don't know.

03:36.710 --> 03:39.060
That might just work.

03:39.170 --> 03:40.700
Select it with the L key.

03:41.790 --> 03:51.300
You and unwrap not too bad kind of like the angle based.

03:51.350 --> 03:52.440
That works pretty well.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.170
I'll take it.

03:54.290 --> 03:55.010
All right.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.870
Let's work on this one here.

03:58.460 --> 04:02.310
Let's try selecting this edge.

04:02.480 --> 04:09.080
And also this edge around the bottom and I'll de-selected these

04:12.020 --> 04:17.820
like that let's mark those edges as seams.

04:17.820 --> 04:24.090
Select this with the L key and you and unwrap that too looks pretty good.

04:24.090 --> 04:31.470
I'll try conformal or angle based not much of a difference there.

04:32.940 --> 04:42.000
So we have the arms and the legs you ve mapped or go ahead and just add a mirror modifier back to each

04:42.000 --> 04:45.440
of these that.

04:45.680 --> 04:53.690
And there's this I think I may want to U-V map these because maybe they'll have some sort of dirt or

04:53.690 --> 04:58.250
burn stains on them from being jet thrusters.

04:58.250 --> 04:58.880
I don't know.

04:58.910 --> 05:02.490
I'm not sure but I'll go ahead and do it.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.770
So I'm going to go back to the U-V editing lay out.

05:06.030 --> 05:15.210
I will bring everything back here and I'll say like this one jetpack isolate it go to Edit mode.

05:15.220 --> 05:30.580
And I think I can put an edge down here in the back maybe one here and in here and de-select these along

05:30.580 --> 05:32.050
the bottom.

05:32.050 --> 05:43.440
So I will mark the seam select everything you and unwrap let's add the checker material and see.

05:43.870 --> 05:46.370
I'll delete this one again.

05:46.810 --> 05:59.220
Take this one duplicate it click and just put a negative in front of the value here and then we go.

05:59.490 --> 06:05.190
So what I'd like to do is kind of a strange thing I'm going to combine this whole thing together once

06:05.190 --> 06:10.980
or at least the parts that I've U-V mapped and I'm going to combine it all into one object.

06:11.040 --> 06:20.640
And then what I'll do is use average Island scales and pack islands to arrange the movies and then I'm

06:20.640 --> 06:25.040
going to break the pieces apart again into their individual components.

06:25.050 --> 06:30.840
And that so that I can have all of the pieces of the mech on one U-V map.

06:30.840 --> 06:39.640
So what I'll do first is go ahead and apply the mirror modifiers I'll just apply this and I'll apply

06:39.640 --> 06:40.780
this here.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.950
So I'll select everything that's been U-V mapped

06:48.600 --> 06:54.410
the jet pack the thrusters and here we go.

06:54.410 --> 07:00.050
So I've got them all selected I'm going to go back to the U-V editors so we can see this and what I'm

07:00.050 --> 07:02.260
going to do is press control J.

07:02.950 --> 07:05.430
And that combines everything into one object.

07:05.450 --> 07:16.190
And now when I go into edit mode you can see all of the movies overlapping each other and that's ugly.

07:16.190 --> 07:17.470
We don't want that.

07:17.840 --> 07:24.380
So what I can do now with all of these selected over here I can press control a and that will average

07:24.470 --> 07:31.940
Island scale that will scale all the islands to be in proportion with the 3D model.

07:31.940 --> 07:37.610
And then I can press control P and pack them all in to this zero to one space.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.260
So that looks pretty good.

07:40.310 --> 07:46.910
All right so now that they're all there like that what I can do is I can break them apart now as I need

07:46.910 --> 07:50.100
to when we begin rigging the Mac.

07:50.150 --> 07:51.300
And that kind of thing.

07:51.560 --> 07:55.070
But for now our Mac has been U-V Matt.

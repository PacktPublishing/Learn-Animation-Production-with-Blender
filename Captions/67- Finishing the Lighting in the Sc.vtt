WEBVTT

00:00.810 --> 00:09.600
What I'd also like in addition to the cone of light coming out of the spotlight is also the lens of

00:09.600 --> 00:12.070
the light needs to kind of glow.

00:12.720 --> 00:18.180
So I'm going to come in here and take a look at that object

00:21.030 --> 00:28.830
where we are and in the material of this object I've got the glass spot lens here and it's only got

00:28.830 --> 00:30.240
a glossy on it.

00:30.450 --> 00:37.060
But what let's do is let's add an emission shader as well we'll kind of mix between the two.

00:37.530 --> 00:43.020
So let's see if the editing lay out that we have will help with this.

00:43.140 --> 00:46.210
I'll zoom into that object here.

00:46.290 --> 00:50.300
So here is the glossy Shater.

00:50.340 --> 00:56.510
And why don't I press shift A and add a mix shader.

00:57.870 --> 01:03.070
And shift day and add an emission.

01:03.640 --> 01:07.330
Well let's go ahead and mix between these two.

01:07.500 --> 01:11.850
I'll go ahead and change the viewport shading to rendered.

01:11.890 --> 01:14.070
And let's take a look at this.

01:14.190 --> 01:21.060
So there we can see our lens and the cone of light coming out of it.

01:21.120 --> 01:27.400
Let's mix between these two and see if we can get that's a little too bright.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.030
Let me bring it down just a little bit.

01:30.820 --> 01:31.800
Something like that.

01:31.810 --> 01:39.430
And we ought to also change the color of this maybe to a more blue to match the cone.

01:40.400 --> 01:49.640
So I can change the glossy as well as the emission so I'll hit the little eyedropper here and sample

01:49.640 --> 01:53.690
that blue and that may be a little bit too blue.

01:55.170 --> 01:56.860
Bring that back a bit.

01:58.800 --> 01:59.180
All right.

01:59.190 --> 02:00.400
Let's go with that.

02:00.570 --> 02:02.420
I think that looks pretty good.

02:02.430 --> 02:06.240
I'll switch back to the default view here.

02:06.240 --> 02:12.500
The next thing I'd like to look at is what we're going to see outside of this hole here.

02:12.510 --> 02:14.870
So what's going on out there.

02:14.880 --> 02:22.860
My original idea is that it's a blue sky that it's a bright day outside and that's what's casting that

02:22.860 --> 02:26.270
shaft of light into the room.

02:26.280 --> 02:30.660
Now there are quite a few ways that you can make a sky.

02:30.660 --> 02:40.380
You can come into the world settings and you can bring in and create a sky texture but that kind of

02:40.380 --> 02:43.380
thing contributes to the light of the scene.

02:43.380 --> 02:47.100
And I kind of have the lighting the way I want it.

02:47.370 --> 02:55.290
And also you can take a big hit on render time you can really increase the time it takes to render each

02:55.290 --> 03:00.270
frame and center going to be rendering 300 and some odd frames.

03:00.270 --> 03:03.630
We don't want it to take a half an hour per frame.

03:03.630 --> 03:13.080
So what I'm going to do is kind of a cheat kind of a Down and dirty way to do this to put something

03:13.080 --> 03:18.170
outside that hole there without increasing the render time a whole lot.

03:18.690 --> 03:27.930
So what I want to do is actually just create a polygon plane and put it outside of that hole and then

03:28.020 --> 03:33.320
map an image of a sky onto it and that's it.

03:33.330 --> 03:36.870
So I have the 3-D cursor up here all ready.

03:36.870 --> 03:44.700
I'll go ahead and just create a polygon plane and let's scale it up quite a bit and I'm going to move

03:44.700 --> 03:52.910
it back and tilt it so that it kind of points down into that plane.

03:52.910 --> 03:56.570
Now let's take a look at it from the camera point of view.

03:56.660 --> 04:04.570
I'm going to hit the zero key here and let's move the camera back to its first frame.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.180
And I'll hit the Z key to take a look at this.

04:08.180 --> 04:17.260
So here is my object up here and that's looking pretty good it looks like it will cover that hole.

04:17.500 --> 04:26.200
I'm going to switch to local mode for my transform orientation and I'm going to scale this down like

04:26.200 --> 04:28.150
this.

04:28.580 --> 04:30.130
Maybe move it.

04:30.200 --> 04:34.060
So I'm just making sure that it's going to cover that hole.

04:34.550 --> 04:36.340
I'm going to tumble back up here.

04:36.350 --> 04:42.230
And also I want to make sure that it isn't intersecting with any geometry and it is here I just want

04:42.230 --> 04:48.980
it to not touch anything not cut through any of the existing objects.

04:49.510 --> 04:51.740
So make sure it's there once again.

04:51.740 --> 04:52.120
OK.

04:52.130 --> 04:55.160
So that looks like it's pretty good.

04:55.160 --> 05:03.590
So now that I have that one thing I'm going to need to do is U-V map it because I'm going to apply a

05:03.590 --> 05:04.780
texture to it.

05:04.970 --> 05:08.560
And of course you need a map to do that.

05:08.600 --> 05:19.580
So I'll go to my U-V editing lay out and let's just go to Edit mode and press you and unwrap and I'll

05:19.580 --> 05:21.310
bring in an image.

05:21.320 --> 05:33.270
I found and I'll bring in an image I found so many a press shift a and bring in an image texture.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.860
I should probably also bring in a texture coordinate

05:42.640 --> 05:53.550
and map the U.V. to the vector and the color to the color and I'll browse for that texture.

05:54.830 --> 06:00.830
Here it is sky too I think.

06:00.960 --> 06:01.360
All right.

06:01.380 --> 06:02.550
Let's take a look at that.

06:02.550 --> 06:04.160
I'm going to save.

06:04.350 --> 06:08.630
And then let's go back to our default view and let's take a look.

06:09.330 --> 06:15.240
Yeah that's looking pretty good it's just got some wisps of clouds there and that's really all I want.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.970
I don't want it to be distracting.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.220
Just want it to look like that there's a world out there that there's something happening.

06:23.220 --> 06:29.500
And frankly with the camera moving in so quickly we're only going to see that for a very short time.

06:31.250 --> 06:37.610
Now the last thing I should deal with in terms of lighting is when the spotlight actually comes on because

06:37.910 --> 06:40.650
I don't want to be on for the entire scene.

06:40.910 --> 06:44.060
I just wanted to come on after he lands.

06:44.180 --> 06:47.170
So let's take a look at how we would do this.

06:47.180 --> 06:55.190
I'm going to go to my animation screen layout and I want to select that light.

06:55.550 --> 07:00.290
So it's down here I believe.

07:01.790 --> 07:03.790
Right here.

07:03.830 --> 07:12.700
So what I need to do is key the light at this point and I want to keep it so it's off.

07:12.710 --> 07:23.240
So with that light selected I'll come over here to the strength and right now it's at 15000.

07:23.270 --> 07:30.330
So what I can do is I can right click on the strength field and choose insert keyframe.

07:30.740 --> 07:38.530
But what I want to do is I want to zero this out first like so and insert a keyframe here.

07:40.980 --> 07:47.840
Now I'd like to bring the mic down here and let me go to the camera view and I'll hit play.

07:48.150 --> 07:49.500
So he comes down

07:52.760 --> 08:02.240
moves forward drops and then I'd like the light to come on.

08:02.250 --> 08:13.990
So just before I'd like the light to come on after he lands and before that light turns so somewhere.

08:14.240 --> 08:21.590
Let's see he drops up light comes on let's say the light comes on to 20.

08:21.870 --> 08:28.690
So I'm going to back up one frame and keep it at zero here to anchor that.

08:28.690 --> 08:38.230
So insert a key frame there and then I'll move forward one frame change it to 15000 again was that right.

08:39.330 --> 08:43.170
And then insert a key frame here.

08:43.170 --> 08:51.900
So now it should stay at 0 strength all the way through here and then turn on that frame 20.

08:51.900 --> 08:59.330
So if I go to frame 19 I'll go ahead and take a look at it in the rendered view.

09:00.150 --> 09:10.750
We can see here that the light is off but that emission shader on the lens is on as well.

09:10.770 --> 09:16.740
So we need to do the same thing for this we need to key that emission off to this point.

09:16.770 --> 09:19.280
And then on on the next frame.

09:19.280 --> 09:28.880
So if I go to the next frame we should see as it renders that that spotlight is on and then we go.

09:29.220 --> 09:29.480
All right.

09:29.480 --> 09:35.300
So let's go back and do the same thing with the emission shader on the lens.

09:35.300 --> 09:45.370
I'll go back to my solid view and go back to frame 2:19 and I'll select the lens.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.360
Let's go to the material

09:50.010 --> 09:56.370
and in the emission Shater let's change this strength.

09:56.500 --> 10:01.980
So it's at one now at frame 2:19 where we are now it should be zero.

10:02.290 --> 10:11.330
So I'll insert a key frame here and then at 220 I'll move forward one frame with the arrow key.

10:11.680 --> 10:19.430
We should be able to change this to one and insert a key frame here.

10:19.660 --> 10:27.080
Now I'll also go back to frame one here and make sure that we've got it keyed at zero there as well.

10:28.400 --> 10:39.830
So now we should be able to see that on frame 219 both the spotlight and the lens are off.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.150
Let's take a look.

10:41.780 --> 10:42.240
Yes.

10:42.290 --> 10:43.560
That looks good.

10:43.670 --> 10:53.050
And then we go forward one frame and now we see the lenses on and the cone should come on as well.

10:54.600 --> 10:54.990
All right.

10:54.990 --> 11:02.070
So there we go we have the lightings set up in the next video we'll move on to seeing what we can do

11:02.070 --> 11:08.370
about creating some sort of jet thruster effect for the next jet pack.

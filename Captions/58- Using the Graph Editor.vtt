00:00.780 --> 00:06.510
Let's see if we can tweak our animation a bit to get the movements to be a little more realistic let's

00:06.510 --> 00:08.400
take a look at it again here.

00:09.890 --> 00:16.640
So he comes down slowly I'd kind of like to see him come down a little quicker and maybe bounce at the

00:16.640 --> 00:17.470
bottom.

00:18.510 --> 00:20.300
Of the drop.

00:20.460 --> 00:22.230
So let's work on that.

00:22.260 --> 00:29.490
So to get him to move down a little quicker we need to reduce the time or reduce the number of frames

00:29.490 --> 00:34.930
between this top key frame and the bottom keyframe.

00:34.950 --> 00:41.760
So what I'll do is I'll press the Beaky and drag select these key frames here and I'll hit the G key

00:41.760 --> 00:44.040
and move them down.

00:44.040 --> 00:48.800
Move them back maybe 30 frames and see how that works.

00:49.080 --> 00:55.390
Go back to the beginning hit play and let's see a little bit better.

00:55.470 --> 00:57.770
Feels like he's moving down a little quicker.

00:57.780 --> 01:03.650
I'm going to bring it down a little more maybe another six frames and see how that works.

01:06.960 --> 01:14.360
I'd be a little fast maybe I'll undo it and let's see how that is.

01:14.670 --> 01:17.670
Yes so that has him coming down a little bit quicker.

01:17.720 --> 01:23.720
Now what I want him to do is kind of bounce a little bit down here at the bottom so I want him to come

01:23.720 --> 01:30.260
down bounce just go down a hair and then back up before he even begins moving forward.

01:31.810 --> 01:36.640
So I'm going to zoom in to my graph editor here.

01:36.700 --> 01:43.480
You can press the home key on your keyboard to frame up all the key frames and then you can use the

01:43.480 --> 01:51.790
Control key and the middle mouse button to kind of collapse the frames or make them bigger or drag left

01:51.880 --> 01:55.600
and right and squish and stretch.

01:55.600 --> 02:03.550
So it isn't changing the placement or position of the keyframes it's just adjusting the view.

02:03.880 --> 02:11.290
So I'm going to scroll in here and let me see if I can find I want to look at this.

02:11.290 --> 02:15.080
Keyframe the graph here that's the y axis.

02:15.090 --> 02:17.070
Let me move this up here.

02:17.390 --> 02:26.120
The y axis is the one that's dictating how quickly he drops this green axis over here right here.

02:26.120 --> 02:30.650
This is the one that's telling us how quickly he's dropping down.

02:30.650 --> 02:38.360
But if you look over here the up and down is the z axis and that's because we're in global transformation

02:38.360 --> 02:39.350
orientation here.

02:39.350 --> 02:42.250
So I'm going to switch from global to local.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.390
And now you can see that Y-axis is pointing up.

02:45.380 --> 02:48.920
So that's just for consistency sake.

02:48.920 --> 02:53.730
I think we should have that up just so we can see which axis we're working with.

02:54.940 --> 03:03.680
So if he comes down here and wants to we want to have him bounce a little bit we may need another keyframe

03:03.850 --> 03:14.590
right in here so if he comes down and bounces right about here what say we take this keyframe and we

03:14.650 --> 03:25.110
duplicate it and then press g and X and move it in the x over to that place there.

03:25.130 --> 03:30.910
So let's see if that's going to that's just going to kind of like he's going to hit a brick wall there.

03:32.580 --> 03:38.650
So I think I also need to duplicate this axis in the Z because that's the one where he's moving forward.

03:38.650 --> 03:47.650
So as he drops it down I kind of want him to stay in place so maybe I'll just move this over I'll hit

03:47.650 --> 03:52.640
G and X and move it over that.

03:52.910 --> 03:54.410
See how that works.

04:03.240 --> 04:07.390
All right so now we can work on our little bounce here.

04:07.890 --> 04:16.470
Maybe I'll move this a little bit to the left and we can take these little bezier handles here and select

04:16.470 --> 04:23.550
them and rotate them like this and that will adjust the curve.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.580
I like that.

04:25.580 --> 04:31.910
Now what we can also do is split them so we can adjust just one side at a time.

04:31.910 --> 04:41.630
So if I select this keyframe and I press the the key on the keyboard I'll see the vector type.

04:41.630 --> 04:50.300
So we can do this free handle here which means I can take one of these and move it around independently.

04:50.410 --> 04:53.910
Now I can make a little dip there.

04:54.320 --> 05:00.620
And for this kind of smooth that curve out so it's a little smoother for this one.

05:00.620 --> 05:09.710
I'll press the key and choose free and then I'll maybe dip this or move this around just a bit to get

05:09.710 --> 05:12.690
more of a smooth curve there.

05:14.340 --> 05:15.440
Something like that.

05:15.450 --> 05:17.430
Let's see how this works that maybe.

05:17.840 --> 05:23.990
Well we'll see.

05:24.100 --> 05:24.540
All right.

05:24.550 --> 05:25.330
We're getting there.

05:25.330 --> 05:30.400
I think I need a little bit more time before he moves on.

05:30.400 --> 05:38.160
So let me move this over and I'll move this over just a hair as well.

05:40.080 --> 05:44.350
And then I'll dip these down just a little more

05:47.400 --> 05:47.820
like.

05:47.860 --> 05:49.340
So let's check that out

05:54.050 --> 05:54.520
yes.

05:54.580 --> 05:58.120
There we get a little bounce there.

05:58.220 --> 05:59.320
That's good.

05:59.930 --> 06:02.210
But it looks like this.

06:02.210 --> 06:04.370
Here is a little bit sharp.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.110
Let's take another look at it.

06:11.440 --> 06:11.760
Yeah.

06:11.770 --> 06:18.310
I want to extend this out just a bit salted G and extend that out a hair like so maybe

06:27.440 --> 06:28.000
right.

06:28.020 --> 06:31.590
So he comes down he pops up.

06:31.590 --> 06:33.700
Maybe I'll bring this up just a bit.

06:33.770 --> 06:41.970
I'll hit G and y move it up maybe move it over in the next a bit and I'll adjust this to smooth that

06:41.970 --> 06:44.720
curve a little more.

06:45.120 --> 06:52.270
Let's see if we can get here.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.950
All right.

06:54.150 --> 06:59.210
It's still a little choppy there's something going on there's a pop happening somewhere.

06:59.850 --> 07:10.430
Let's take a look at this here.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.620
I think it may just be happening too quickly.

07:16.250 --> 07:17.490
I'll go like this.

07:24.400 --> 07:24.990
Yeah.

07:25.090 --> 07:29.040
Well now it's not now it's not bouncing.

07:29.230 --> 07:30.370
So I'll move it back

07:33.170 --> 07:36.140
maybe extend this a little bit.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.700
So this is really the process of animating right here.

07:39.750 --> 07:43.070
I'm just trying to find something that's going to work

07:55.990 --> 07:56.580
all right.

07:56.580 --> 08:03.180
So now I'm going to work on the little dip here as it moves forward.

08:03.570 --> 08:10.290
I'm going to remove this keyframe one of the things that I see very often is when people find a problem

08:10.290 --> 08:13.290
with their animations something is happening too quickly.

08:13.310 --> 08:16.680
There is a sharp turn and there's a pop.

08:16.710 --> 08:22.210
People tend to try and fix those kinds of problems by adding keyframes.

08:22.260 --> 08:30.510
And what I think is that oftentimes or the majority of the time the problem can be solved by deleting

08:30.510 --> 08:31.720
a keyframe.

08:31.950 --> 08:39.780
So I'm going to go ahead and delete this keyframe here and select it at the x key and delete and then

08:39.810 --> 08:46.670
I can come in here and change the handles to free and do a little bit of adjusting here.

08:50.710 --> 08:56.070
To kind of smooth out that curve and let's see how this works.

09:04.690 --> 09:05.390
All right.

09:05.390 --> 09:13.380
So there's that so far I'm going to take this and I don't think I want it to dip down quite so far.

09:15.160 --> 09:25.040
So I'll move this up with G and Y and move it up a bit like that see how this works.

09:25.100 --> 09:36.070
I must feel like that if these keyframes moved forward a bit speeding up that drop that bounce would

09:36.070 --> 09:37.990
be a little bit more believable.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.680
So I'll press the G key and move it forward.

09:40.810 --> 09:44.350
And let's see if we can increase the speed of that drop.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.170
Little too much

09:51.730 --> 09:52.320
try that

09:57.490 --> 09:58.360
right.

09:58.390 --> 10:01.280
I'm going to move it over two more frames like that.

10:02.700 --> 10:03.580
Let's try that.

10:09.680 --> 10:17.410
I'm going to reduce the height of this one by pressing g y and move that one down a bit like that.

10:17.540 --> 10:21.200
So it doesn't come back up quite as much.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.550
Now I'm going to take this in and extend it just a bit like this.

10:24.590 --> 10:34.490
Now this keyframe may not be necessary we may be able to do what we want to do by adjusting the bezier

10:34.520 --> 10:36.110
handles instead.

10:36.140 --> 10:37.750
Let me show you what I mean here.

10:37.760 --> 10:43.060
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to press the x key to delete this.

10:43.310 --> 10:51.650
And now if I come over here if I want a smooth dip in this curve I can press the key and kind of go

10:51.650 --> 10:57.800
like this and then use the handles here free these with the key.

10:57.860 --> 11:06.310
Select this and maybe dip this down like that something like that.

11:06.310 --> 11:07.780
Now let's test that out.

11:16.230 --> 11:16.920
All right.

11:17.280 --> 11:21.220
So now what let's do is let's work on the drop here.

11:21.510 --> 11:24.840
I think we're probably going to need to insert a key frame though.

11:26.080 --> 11:33.810
Well let's see maybe I can adjust this and then have it drop.

11:34.030 --> 11:43.990
Let's try it.

11:44.010 --> 11:46.940
All right it needs to drop a little quicker there.

11:47.450 --> 11:52.610
So I'm going to move this a bit like this.

11:52.610 --> 12:03.680
And let's see how this works.

12:03.870 --> 12:05.480
That's not too bad.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.280
So that's the general process.

12:07.290 --> 12:09.920
I'll be going through as I animate this.

12:10.110 --> 12:17.400
I think the key takeaways here is that oftentimes deleting a keyframe is a better option than adding

12:18.030 --> 12:26.850
and that you can break the tangents here or you can adjust the handles of these points individually

12:26.850 --> 12:30.850
by selecting it and then pressing V and choosing free.

12:31.020 --> 12:37.470
And that allows you to really have a lot more control over how the curve behaves.

12:37.470 --> 12:43.830
So in the next video we'll begin working on the more detailed movements of how the mech moves while

12:43.830 --> 12:44.660
he's flying.

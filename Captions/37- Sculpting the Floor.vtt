00:00.770 --> 00:07.710
Well let's take a look at using the sculpting tools to give a little texture to the floor and other

00:07.710 --> 00:09.400
objects in the scene.

00:09.410 --> 00:18.630
And I'm just looking for a kind of texture like this and maybe rough up a few of the pieces like the

00:18.660 --> 00:24.810
coffin and the stairs when you're doing sculpting you really need a pen and tablet.

00:24.810 --> 00:30.350
I've got a away come tablet here with a pen.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.060
It's not an expensive one.

00:32.060 --> 00:34.840
It's a pretty small one it's in in to us.

00:35.100 --> 00:41.630
But just the amount of control that you can get with a pen and tablet over a mouse is really useful.

00:41.700 --> 00:46.800
I really recommend getting a pen and tablet I'll work on the floor.

00:46.790 --> 00:54.170
First I'll select it and I'll isolate it with the division key.

00:54.220 --> 01:03.760
Now if I go over to the modifiers panel here and click on Add modifier I can add a multi resolution

01:03.850 --> 01:04.510
modifier.

01:04.510 --> 01:10.890
Now this is similar to the subdivisions surface modifier in that it can smooth an object.

01:11.170 --> 01:20.140
But the nice thing about this is that you have the ability to create multiple levels of subdivisions.

01:20.470 --> 01:30.010
If I were to say add a subdivision here I could click add new level of subdivision if I click that if

01:30.010 --> 01:37.600
I press the Z key and as I click subdivide you can see that it begins to subdivide the mesh more and

01:37.600 --> 01:38.200
more.

01:38.620 --> 01:45.730
But it's just a modifier it's it's previewing it's not actually applying that higher resolution to the

01:45.730 --> 01:47.430
mesh quite yet.

01:47.800 --> 01:54.980
If I hit the tab key you can see that we're still at the original subdivision level here in edit mode

01:55.750 --> 02:03.410
but if we look at it in wireframe we can see all of the subdivided polygons there.

02:03.850 --> 02:08.740
So with three sculped subdivisions I'll see what I can do with this.

02:08.740 --> 02:16.120
Now the pre-view subdivisions is what you can see here in the viewport in Object mode.

02:16.120 --> 02:23.650
The sculped subdivisions is what you can see over here in sculped mode if I click on object mode I can

02:23.650 --> 02:31.780
change it to sculpt mode and then the render subdivisions is what you'll see when the scene is actually

02:31.840 --> 02:33.070
rendered out.

02:33.100 --> 02:39.250
Now that I've clicked on the sculped tool you can see that I've got my sculped tools panel over here

02:40.210 --> 02:40.870
up at the top.

02:40.870 --> 02:44.810
I've got a collection of Prussia's that I can use.

02:44.920 --> 02:51.880
And generally speaking I begin with something like the sculped draw brush which is kind of the default

02:51.940 --> 02:52.640
brush.

02:52.840 --> 03:01.210
But you've got a lot of other options here like Clay strips and blob and grab and inflate.

03:01.330 --> 03:08.680
These are all great options and we'll go through some of these as we sculpt the various parts of our

03:08.680 --> 03:12.880
environment in addition to our brushes.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.850
You've got a radius and strength slider here.

03:16.900 --> 03:21.250
Let me open this panel just a little bit.

03:21.250 --> 03:27.730
And what these control is the brush you can see the red circle here around my cursor.

03:27.730 --> 03:37.170
The radius is the size of the brush and the strength is of course how strong the brush is on the object.

03:37.190 --> 03:46.330
You can also change the radius and strength of the brush by pressing the F key for radius and then click.

03:46.610 --> 03:52.820
Or you can press shift F to increase or decrease the strength.

03:52.820 --> 03:55.250
There are a lot of settings in this panel.

03:55.250 --> 04:02.870
Not all of which were going to go through at this point in time but another setting to look at is the

04:03.020 --> 04:04.970
symmetry tool here.

04:05.150 --> 04:11.690
Scroll down and we can see that we've got symmetry on and that will mirror what we do on one side of

04:11.690 --> 04:14.750
the axis on to the other side.

04:14.750 --> 04:21.890
So let's say I am going to make a stroke over here like this.

04:22.010 --> 04:24.530
You can see that it also makes a stroke.

04:24.710 --> 04:27.230
On the other side of the x axis.

04:27.590 --> 04:32.010
So for this I don't think I want symmetry on so I'm going to turn that off.

04:32.030 --> 04:34.290
I don't need that.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.700
Another option is add and subtract.

04:36.700 --> 04:44.680
If you look at the brush here when I draw here it adds or bulges out the mesh.

04:44.680 --> 04:52.510
But you can also click subtract here and that will push it in an easier way to do that I think.

04:52.550 --> 05:00.680
Let me just undo this is when it's on and just press the control button on the keyboard and then drag

05:00.820 --> 05:05.690
a stroke and that will cut into the object.

05:05.690 --> 05:07.340
So I'll undo those.

05:07.340 --> 05:12.950
So as you've seen when we draw a stroke out here it's kind of blocky.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.800
It's not real smooth.

05:15.760 --> 05:24.030
We could increase our subdivisions here by just clicking on subdivide again and maybe one more time

05:24.570 --> 05:29.100
till we're up to five in our sculped view.

05:29.100 --> 05:31.410
So now let's try this.

05:31.550 --> 05:32.420
That's pretty good.

05:32.420 --> 05:37.060
We've got a pretty good relatively smooth stroke there.

05:37.070 --> 05:42.530
I think that should probably do so to sculpt a sand kind of texture.

05:42.530 --> 05:49.100
I'm going to press the division key to bring all my other objects back and what I want to do is just

05:49.100 --> 05:55.080
barely bring up the floor.

05:55.080 --> 05:59.750
So it looks as if sand has been blown around in here.

05:59.760 --> 06:08.220
I'm going to increase the size of my brush really reduce the strength with shift F.

06:08.310 --> 06:16.060
Let's see what I can do here if I just begin sculpting it's kind of hard to see isn't it.

06:16.420 --> 06:24.010
Let's come over here to the properties panel by pressing in and let's click on shading.

06:24.010 --> 06:32.560
Now there should be a feature here or a checkbox called madcap but I don't see it because I'm in textured

06:32.560 --> 06:32.890
view.

06:32.890 --> 06:36.160
I need to switch from textured to solid view.

06:36.370 --> 06:43.820
And now I can see a feature called matte cap and what this will do is just change the look of your scene.

06:43.990 --> 06:51.320
It's applied a different kind of material to our scene and this is just really for viewing purposes.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.880
So we can kind of see what we're doing here.

06:54.880 --> 07:00.690
We could select this one or if we click on this sphere we can select any one of these.

07:00.700 --> 07:05.230
These aren't actual materials that you'd see in a rendered scene.

07:05.230 --> 07:09.900
These are materials just to help you work when you're sculpting.

07:09.940 --> 07:17.270
So I'm going to click this it's still not given me what I want to see.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.680
Let's try something like this.

07:19.750 --> 07:28.450
What I'm trying to do is find a material that will allow me to see what I'm doing a little better.

07:28.550 --> 07:30.570
This one's pretty good.

07:30.590 --> 07:32.250
I'll try this one.

07:32.300 --> 07:39.290
It may look a little strange but as I said these materials are just to help you see what you're doing

07:39.350 --> 07:40.550
in the viewport.

07:40.820 --> 07:51.260
So press in again and now begin coming back in here and using the sculpt tool to kind of form this object.

07:51.280 --> 07:59.340
And I'm just going to begin to sculpt around the columns and bring that bring that floor up a bit.

07:59.340 --> 08:03.200
So it kind of molds around the objects here.

08:04.310 --> 08:10.270
I kind of want to make sure the place where the mech is going to land is fairly flat.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.070
I don't want to do too much there.

08:13.090 --> 08:20.740
The next thing I could try is to add a texture to this so if I come down here to texture and click on

08:20.740 --> 08:23.180
new.

08:23.500 --> 08:31.030
Now if I come over here to the materials panel I can see my sand material on the floor here I'm going

08:31.030 --> 08:38.650
to come over here to the texture panel and now I can see that texture I created over here so I could

08:38.650 --> 08:44.470
call this sand as well and that will update over here.

08:44.470 --> 08:51.190
Now I would need to choose what type of texture I'm going to use for this particular brush I'll choose

08:51.190 --> 08:59.150
type and for this maybe choose noise texture.

08:59.920 --> 09:06.910
And when we go I'll switch back to my solid views so I can see the matte cap.

09:06.910 --> 09:17.320
I'll adjust the brush size maybe like this and I'll come in here and just begin lightly creating some

09:18.070 --> 09:19.680
texture around here.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.510
Right something like that.

09:25.700 --> 09:33.950
I'm going to switch over to my camera by pressing the zero key and then I'll go ahead and switch over

09:33.950 --> 09:39.370
to render it and see if we can see anything.

09:39.450 --> 09:42.660
So I'm seeing a little bit of texture in here.

09:42.660 --> 09:48.670
Now we'll continue sculpting on the coffin and the stairs here.

09:48.810 --> 09:49.410
Up next.

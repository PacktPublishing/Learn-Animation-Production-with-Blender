WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:07.830
Continuing on with the materials of the mech Let's take a look at the tubes and the spotlight on top

00:07.830 --> 00:08.930
of him.

00:09.090 --> 00:13.970
If I zoom in here let's take a look at these pieces.

00:14.430 --> 00:22.880
So the tubes here are still curves they're not polygon objects yet.

00:23.130 --> 00:28.490
If we press the Z key we can see the curve here.

00:28.620 --> 00:34.050
If we hit the tab key we can still see the Bezier curves in here.

00:34.050 --> 00:38.190
I think I'm going to continue to leave them as curves for now.

00:38.190 --> 00:41.410
I still don't need to change them to polygons.

00:41.490 --> 00:44.630
We may in the future once we begin rigging them back.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.860
But for now I'll go ahead and leave them as curves.

00:48.030 --> 00:51.430
So we have a rubber material already created.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.350
Let's take a look at that.

00:53.430 --> 00:59.220
The rubber mech joints material we could assign these to that material.

00:59.220 --> 01:00.850
Let's take a look at that.

01:00.850 --> 01:04.280
Let me switch over to my rendering viewport.

01:04.600 --> 01:08.190
Now I think I'd like these to be a different color.

01:08.190 --> 01:14.720
So I think what I'll do is go ahead and create a new material slot here and then create a new material

01:16.610 --> 01:22.900
and for this material let's call it rubber neck tubes.

01:23.750 --> 01:27.790
And I think this material should be a little bit darker.

01:27.830 --> 01:31.260
I'll take it down quite a bit like that.

01:32.280 --> 01:39.750
Not much has changed here but if I take this particular one and remove this material slot from this

01:39.810 --> 01:47.220
object now we see that the only material left is that tube material.

01:47.220 --> 01:55.560
So I think this is the one I want to go with I'll go back to my texturing viewport Slyke that hose and

01:55.620 --> 02:03.780
I will add that rubber mask tubes to it and that just switches it out here.

02:03.900 --> 02:10.450
So if I go back to my rendered view you can see that that material has been applied.

02:10.470 --> 02:10.720
All right.

02:10.740 --> 02:16.740
I'll switch back to my textured view again and I'll select one of these and this and this.

02:16.830 --> 02:24.240
These little pieces here I think I'll just use that metal mech trim for these.

02:24.370 --> 02:26.530
All right let's take a look at this.

02:26.560 --> 02:34.460
Spotlight for this I think I'd like to have the metal trim be on this.

02:34.460 --> 02:40.000
And I think up here I'd like kind of a black and gray kind of theme up here.

02:40.430 --> 02:47.930
What I need to do is just establish base material for this as you seen when we create material for an

02:47.930 --> 02:48.550
object.

02:48.560 --> 02:56.300
It applies that first material to the whole thing and then we have to go back and select faces and add

02:56.360 --> 02:59.360
new materials to collections of faces.

02:59.360 --> 03:08.570
So for this entire one let's go ahead and add that trim metal mech trim here we'll add that whole thing.

03:08.600 --> 03:15.610
So I'll go into edit mode and I'll select this piece up here with the L key and this is a rubber piece.

03:15.620 --> 03:22.060
Once again I'm going to go ahead and create a new material slot.

03:23.570 --> 03:28.220
And I'll sign that rubber mech joints to it.

03:28.220 --> 03:34.100
Now click a sign so I should have something that looks like this.

03:34.100 --> 03:34.980
Let's take a look.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.660
Almost maybe think I should use the other one the black.

03:39.850 --> 03:42.470
Let's try that one or the tubes.

03:44.150 --> 03:55.550
Then let's take a look at this piece here and a frame up on that one I'd like to do is have a combination

03:55.610 --> 03:58.030
of gray and black here.

03:58.250 --> 04:05.900
I think I'll go to face mode and select these faces and then I'll use the control plus key combination

04:05.900 --> 04:08.460
here to expand the selection.

04:08.690 --> 04:14.170
And I think what I want to do is create a new material so I create a new material slot for this object.

04:15.430 --> 04:26.260
Creating new material and I'll call this metal metal black spot light and I'll give it a colossi

04:28.780 --> 04:30.510
and I'll take the color down.

04:30.520 --> 04:37.630
Pretty dark and increase the roughness quite a bit here.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.220
So let's take a look at that.

04:41.730 --> 04:42.080
Oh.

04:42.150 --> 04:45.740
And I need to assign it.

04:45.860 --> 04:49.240
Now we go that's a little too dark.

04:49.430 --> 04:54.030
Let's increase that a bit like so.

04:54.510 --> 04:58.180
I'll come back here and go to that textured view.

04:58.190 --> 05:03.880
And now I'll select individual faces here.

05:07.340 --> 05:15.010
So I've selected these pieces and once again I'll press control plus and expand these out just a bit

05:15.680 --> 05:19.850
and I'll assign these to that black metal as well.

05:19.850 --> 05:24.310
I think I'd like to switch this piece back to that lighter gray.

05:24.470 --> 05:28.850
So instead of this tube's one I'll switch it to the joints one

05:33.090 --> 05:34.820
and then we go.

05:35.380 --> 05:42.810
And I think lastly I'll select this fear here and assign this that black metal as well.

05:43.650 --> 05:49.030
I'll select that and let's create a whole new material now.

05:49.570 --> 05:59.020
I'll create a new material slot new material and we'll call this glass spot lens.

05:59.870 --> 06:09.700
And for this I'll create a glossy material and let's assign it assign those faces to that material.

06:10.730 --> 06:12.060
And let's take a look.

06:13.790 --> 06:20.270
So that may be a little bit too much in terms of the reflectivity.

06:20.270 --> 06:28.070
Now for the fingers I think what I'll do is just assign them that trim metal material for now and see

06:28.070 --> 06:29.380
how that works.

06:29.480 --> 06:38.900
So I'll just select the fingers and in the material pull down I'll select that metal neck trim and then

06:38.990 --> 06:41.260
back here this little panel.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.630
Let's take a look at this.

06:42.740 --> 06:52.810
I think for this to begin with the metal mech trim and then I'll come in with the individual pieces

06:52.810 --> 06:55.020
and select these.

06:55.090 --> 07:03.050
So maybe this and this has a material that's similar.

07:03.070 --> 07:04.840
So I'll create this.

07:04.840 --> 07:08.540
We'll call this let's just call all these panel.

07:08.860 --> 07:10.860
So this will be Panel blue

07:14.220 --> 07:15.720
something like that.

07:18.640 --> 07:29.020
We'll make these different colors so this will be like a panel maybe a this one will be maybe an orange

07:29.020 --> 07:29.430
light.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.870
So I'll call it panel orange.

07:31.980 --> 07:38.890
Now to see what we're doing a little better I can switch from textured to material viewport shading.

07:39.190 --> 07:42.280
And when we do that we can at least see the colors.

07:42.280 --> 07:48.250
Granted we don't see the actual properties of the material but we can at least tell what color we're

07:48.250 --> 07:49.210
putting on it.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.770
So I'll select this one here.

07:53.570 --> 07:56.090
And I'll call this panel red

08:01.910 --> 08:10.130
change it to red and assign it it doesn't look great but we can work with that at least.

08:10.130 --> 08:15.770
Now we have the materials on there and we can adjust the materials as we go.

08:15.790 --> 08:21.220
Looks like the last thing I need to do is sign something to the joints down there on the foot.

08:21.230 --> 08:22.600
Let's take a look at that.

08:22.940 --> 08:29.060
Oh and I also need to assign materials to the rubber feet as well.

08:29.060 --> 08:30.120
So let's do that.

08:30.140 --> 08:40.740
I'll take this joint and I'll assign it to the sign that the trim material and for this one over here

08:40.740 --> 08:41.510
as well.

08:43.080 --> 08:49.680
For the rubber pieces we're going to need to bring them back up aren't we too.

08:49.710 --> 08:54.380
He's not exactly standing on the ground plane here.

08:54.450 --> 08:57.720
But for now actually that's maybe easier to get to.

08:57.720 --> 09:00.500
So let's go ahead and do this.

09:00.800 --> 09:07.130
I'll select all of these and let's assign the rubber to that.

09:07.170 --> 09:13.960
So click a sign and let's do the same thing over here.

09:13.990 --> 09:14.460
All right.

09:14.470 --> 09:20.180
I think our Mac now has materials assigned to all the pieces of it.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.860
We're going to need those materials as we create the look and feel of the neck.

09:24.220 --> 09:25.670
But that'll work for now.

09:25.720 --> 09:30.060
And we can move on to setting up the materials for the environment.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.420
Now for the rest of the scene the environment.

09:33.610 --> 09:36.590
I don't think we need that many materials at all.

09:36.610 --> 09:42.420
I think I'll create one here for the floor and call this sand.

09:42.640 --> 09:43.790
Let me do that.

09:45.830 --> 09:47.920
Just call it sand.

09:49.310 --> 09:56.050
And this one can be just an off white for now.

09:56.060 --> 09:57.680
Something like that.

09:57.740 --> 10:00.610
Let me take this away.

10:00.760 --> 10:04.890
So we should have something that looks kind of like that.

10:04.960 --> 10:10.440
Now the walls I think are going to be a different material as well as the ceiling.

10:10.600 --> 10:20.320
That's going to be maybe stone solid stone so I'll go ahead and select one of these walls and I'll create

10:20.320 --> 10:29.060
a new material slot and I'll call this new and let's call this was and for this is well I'll just change

10:29.060 --> 10:37.010
the color a little bit and keep in mind this is just the colors are all temporary just kind of placeholders

10:37.520 --> 10:47.580
and I'll remove this I'll go ahead and do the same for these so I can select these walls shifts like

10:47.580 --> 10:50.390
that and the ceiling.

10:50.570 --> 10:57.170
And then if I shift select this wall it has its material already assigned.

10:57.170 --> 11:04.400
Now if I press control L I can link those to the material and there we go.

11:04.400 --> 11:09.090
So that assigns the wall materials to all those other objects as well.

11:10.250 --> 11:17.320
I think I may make the pillars and the beams all the same material.

11:17.330 --> 11:29.170
So for this pillar all added material slot call this well pillars and beams and I'll give that a little

11:29.170 --> 11:37.460
bit of a color to it just a slight something and remove the checker now.

11:37.700 --> 11:46.480
Now I'll go through and select all the pillars all the beams and these pillars caps.

11:46.700 --> 11:54.680
And then lastly select that pillar that has a material on it and press control Al and choose materials

11:56.920 --> 12:02.170
and then these blocks and the stairs all make one material as well.

12:02.200 --> 12:15.390
So I create I'll select these create a material slot new and we'll call this blocks and stairs and we'll

12:15.390 --> 12:17.460
give it a slight color as well.

12:19.470 --> 12:27.790
All right so I'll remove the checker and add that to this.

12:27.800 --> 12:34.010
So now we should be able to take a look at it in the rendered viewport shading and see wow that really

12:34.250 --> 12:36.450
brightened up the room now didn't it.

12:36.890 --> 12:37.610
But that's OK.

12:37.610 --> 12:43.600
This is all still temporary but we're beginning to see what the room might look like now.

12:44.030 --> 12:50.580
So just for the time being I can take this light object and turn the intensity down a bit.

12:50.750 --> 13:01.880
Something like 10 or maybe even 5 and I could also bring the ambient occlusion down Sam as well.

13:04.130 --> 13:12.720
To maybe point 1 5 and I'll go and select the Mac and zoom in.

13:12.720 --> 13:19.560
Now my thought is that the lighting in the room ultimately will be more contrasty kind of like that

13:19.620 --> 13:27.960
reference image we had earlier kind of like this that there'll be pools of light and pockets of darkness

13:27.990 --> 13:35.900
and shadow but I think now we're able to get a sense of the basic materials and look of the scene.

13:35.980 --> 13:43.900
What I'd like to do next is to work a little bit on sculpting since we've got all this sand on the floor

13:43.900 --> 13:44.650
in the room.

13:44.650 --> 13:51.790
I'd like to do some I'd like to introduce the sculpting tools to create that on the floor.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.100
So that's coming up next.

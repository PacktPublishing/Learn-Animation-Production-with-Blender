00:00.660 --> 00:08.970
Well it's time to move on to another part of the process and that is rigging the mech for rigging we're

00:08.970 --> 00:11.740
only going to need to see this guy here.

00:12.150 --> 00:17.510
So I'll just select his layer and make sure everything else is on another layer.

00:17.790 --> 00:26.250
And while it looks like we need to move this maybe I'll select this light and I'll press him and choose

00:26.260 --> 00:29.030
layer one to move that over there.

00:29.040 --> 00:38.540
So now we have him isolated and ready to work on all come out of textured mode and go back to solid

00:38.550 --> 00:42.430
because we don't need to see any of the textures or materials.

00:42.960 --> 00:48.510
Before we begin rigging we need to do some cleanup here we need to do some housekeeping chores.

00:48.630 --> 00:53.550
I had mentioned before that it looked like the feet weren't on the ground plan and I went ahead and

00:53.550 --> 00:54.750
fixed that.

00:54.780 --> 00:59.230
Let me go to the three key and the five key and just mention this.

00:59.250 --> 01:09.000
I pulled everything up so the feet kind of sit on the ground plane here and I should mention that it

01:09.000 --> 01:14.230
is really best to have your character in the center of the grid the way I have him here.

01:14.250 --> 01:21.060
Before you begin rigging so you may have noticed that I've kind of built the whole environment around

01:21.060 --> 01:25.130
him and where he's going to land at the end of the scene.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.890
I think this is a good practice to get into.

01:27.930 --> 01:35.730
You'll see here as we go that there are a lot of tools and functions that you can use that are based

01:35.730 --> 01:42.790
around the center of the grid like mirroring the joints from one side of the character to the other.

01:43.140 --> 01:48.750
There's just a lot of benefits to making sure when you're dealing with a character that is in the center

01:48.750 --> 01:56.250
of the grid and for this character he's going to have a lot of different pieces that are going to be

01:56.250 --> 02:04.740
moving around and we're going to need to be able to parent those pieces to the individual bones that

02:04.740 --> 02:06.630
are going to drive them that are going to move them.

02:06.630 --> 02:12.480
So we're going to have a skeleton underneath this character that we're going to animate.

02:12.480 --> 02:19.680
We are not going to animate the character directly we'll be animating the skeleton within the character.

02:19.680 --> 02:26.370
So we need to go back and break up this Mac into its moving parts.

02:26.370 --> 02:31.430
Currently I have the whole thing pretty much the whole thing.

02:31.950 --> 02:32.860
As one object.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.300
But that's not going to work.

02:35.340 --> 02:43.740
So let's start thinking about how we can break up and combine this to make rigging a little easier.

02:43.770 --> 02:47.120
I'm going to press the tab key to go into edit mode here.

02:47.220 --> 02:56.610
So what I want to do is first of all break out the pieces of the body into its own object so I'm just

02:56.610 --> 03:06.460
going to press the L key hovering over each piece pressing L for the pack and all of these.

03:06.460 --> 03:13.000
Now because I have seams on here I'm having to do that multiple times maybe I should get rid of the

03:13.000 --> 03:13.570
seams.

03:13.570 --> 03:15.220
Let me do that.

03:15.400 --> 03:24.550
I will select everything and press control and I'll clear seams so we don't have to worry about selecting

03:24.820 --> 03:27.610
multiple parts of the same object.

03:27.940 --> 03:35.810
So I'll select these with the L key and get all these together.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.660
There we go so we have all those pieces.

03:39.810 --> 03:45.860
Now I'll split them out with the P key and I'll separate them by selection.

03:47.080 --> 03:58.420
So now that is its own piece and I'll find that here and it looks like it's called Jet 00.

03:58.630 --> 04:01.720
So I'll call this mech body.

04:03.970 --> 04:06.280
And I need to add a couple of things to this.

04:06.280 --> 04:16.330
I need to add this little gril here so I'll take that and shift select the body press control J and

04:16.330 --> 04:22.120
that will bring that gril into the mech body object.

04:22.120 --> 04:31.030
Now I want to bring in the base of the spotlight into the body component so I'll hit tab and select

04:33.820 --> 04:41.640
these parts of the spotlight press P split those out into their own piece.

04:41.710 --> 04:51.090
So all tab out of there de-select everything else like that piece and then shift select body and then

04:51.090 --> 04:52.350
press control.

04:54.090 --> 05:02.180
And that bring them into that object I'm going to keep the spotlight its own piece because that's going

05:02.180 --> 05:04.170
to need to move.

05:04.250 --> 05:11.600
I'll take a look at these pieces here these pieces also need to be part of the main body so I'll select

05:11.600 --> 05:15.960
those Schiff's select the Meck body and control J.

05:17.060 --> 05:19.330
We'll bring those in.

05:19.630 --> 05:21.600
Let's look at the panel back here.

05:21.610 --> 05:23.220
Do I have this is its own piece.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.450
Sure enough.

05:24.450 --> 05:33.270
I'll select that shifts like the mech body control J and brings it in OK.

05:33.790 --> 05:37.360
Now these tubes we finally need to deal with these.

05:37.480 --> 05:42.450
I'm going to select this and remember that this is still a curve.

05:43.270 --> 05:46.830
If we hit TAB we can see the curves here.

05:46.900 --> 05:51.040
We're going to need to make this I think it will be easier.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.270
Let me put it that way.

05:52.510 --> 05:58.000
I think it'll be easier if these are part of the Meck body object.

05:58.120 --> 06:04.450
So to do that I need to convert these two polygons so I can combine them to the polygon objects of the

06:04.450 --> 06:05.780
Mech..

06:05.800 --> 06:14.160
So I'm going to select one of the tubes go to object scroll on up here to convert to.

06:14.520 --> 06:20.210
And I want to convert to a mesh polygon mesh from a curve.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.990
So I click that.

06:22.110 --> 06:27.260
And now that converts it from a curve to a polygon.

06:27.350 --> 06:34.050
So if I hit tab you see that we can see the polygons of the two.

06:34.070 --> 06:35.280
I'll do that with the other one.

06:35.360 --> 06:43.180
You can also press alt C and then choose Masch from curve and there we go.

06:43.180 --> 06:51.600
So now these two pieces we need to select Schiff's select the Meck body press control J.

06:52.860 --> 06:57.620
And now those are brought into the fold of the mech body.

06:57.630 --> 07:04.590
And notice what it did to it went ahead and applied that subdivision surface modifier to the tubes as

07:04.590 --> 07:05.820
well.

07:05.820 --> 07:11.090
So the next piece we need to look at is these arms.

07:11.400 --> 07:18.090
Each of these arm pieces segments are going to rotate around a joint.

07:18.090 --> 07:22.710
So this upper arm piece will rotate around this joint.

07:22.710 --> 07:26.310
So those two pieces need to be one object.

07:26.310 --> 07:36.600
So I'm going to tab into edit mode and select the upper arm with the L key as well as that sphere and

07:36.600 --> 07:41.070
I'll press the P key and I'll separate those out by selection.

07:41.100 --> 07:45.900
So now I go back to object mode de-select everything like that.

07:46.080 --> 07:55.470
And I'll call this arm up and I'll add dot L for the left side.

07:55.590 --> 07:57.360
So that's the upper arm.

07:57.660 --> 08:01.000
So I'll do the same thing down here.

08:01.170 --> 08:12.640
I will tab into edit mode select this with the L key as well as that elbow press the key selection.

08:13.490 --> 08:14.300
And now

08:17.390 --> 08:20.780
I can select it and give it a name.

08:20.870 --> 08:28.490
You know what I can do is I can open the properties panel here and scroll down and under item I can

08:28.490 --> 08:30.120
rename it here.

08:30.230 --> 08:37.140
So I'll call this arm low for the lower arm dot L for the left side.

08:38.370 --> 08:41.970
Now for the hand I'm going to go ahead and make this its own object.

08:42.150 --> 08:51.330
So I'll tap into edit mode select the hand sphere here with the L key press P and separate by selection

08:52.020 --> 09:02.560
and alt tab out of edit mode de-select everything selected just that hand and call it hand L and I'm

09:02.560 --> 09:07.550
going to go ahead and go through the entire process with each of these fingers as well.

09:07.720 --> 09:12.080
And what I'm going to do is have them rotate at the joint.

09:12.310 --> 09:13.620
So let me just show you what I mean.

09:13.620 --> 09:26.130
So for like this one if I select this object this this and this frame up that that it's going to all

09:26.130 --> 09:28.410
be one object.

09:28.670 --> 09:32.870
So let me just separate that by selection.

09:33.830 --> 09:38.800
Tab back into object mode dislike everything and like just that piece.

09:38.810 --> 09:44.930
So this is going to be one individual object and this I can call.

09:45.140 --> 09:47.700
Let's call this.

09:47.950 --> 09:56.870
Call it finger made three dot L and this one here will then be at me.

09:56.890 --> 10:03.650
Select this all of these are separate this out.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.050
Select it.

10:05.070 --> 10:11.970
This one will be finger mid to dot L and on back.

10:11.970 --> 10:20.550
So then I'll just I'll select this one piece and this will be finger made one dot L and I'll do that

10:20.550 --> 10:25.260
for the index for the pinky for the thumb.

10:25.350 --> 10:30.480
So each one of the joints of the fingers will be its own object.

10:30.540 --> 10:34.290
So I'll go ahead and begin working on that.

10:34.290 --> 10:37.720
All right so what I've done is I've gone ahead and split these up.

10:37.770 --> 10:44.850
You can see that this one is finger thumb three and your thumb two finger thumb one and the reason why

10:44.850 --> 10:53.820
I've just had them all begin with finger is so they'll all line up alphabetically and in the outliner

10:54.330 --> 10:54.710
but.

10:54.720 --> 10:59.630
So these are a finger index one two and three finger mid.

10:59.670 --> 11:10.440
One two and three and fingered pinky one two and three and they coincide to these three pieces for two

11:10.440 --> 11:11.320
of the digits.

11:11.460 --> 11:21.550
And then just that single cube for the third digit they're so I'll need to do that to the other side

11:21.550 --> 11:22.100
as well.

11:22.120 --> 11:30.130
But for now I'm going to come in here and work on the legs and I'll select the upper leg piece and that

11:30.220 --> 11:36.520
upper leg joint press P separate by selection.

11:36.890 --> 11:39.810
Go back out to object mode de-select everything.

11:39.920 --> 11:43.530
So like that and we'll call this leg up.

11:43.610 --> 11:53.780
Well down here same thing it's like this piece and that joint and then piece selection

11:56.210 --> 11:56.920
selected.

11:56.940 --> 12:01.150
And call that leg low that El.

00:01.010 --> 00:06.760
Now that the environment is U-V mapped Let's go ahead and work on the movies for the Mac.

00:06.910 --> 00:10.460
I'll go ahead and just go to the layer that he's on.

00:10.460 --> 00:15.010
Actually I should mention there are some things I don't think I'm going to use the map on this.

00:15.010 --> 00:24.590
I think for things like the joints here at the shoulder or the elbow the hands and the joints at the

00:24.590 --> 00:34.910
legs I probably won't do too much U-V mapping with fingers or even with the joints down here at the

00:34.910 --> 00:35.790
feet.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.770
The same may be true for the light fixture.

00:39.770 --> 00:42.150
I'm not sure about that but.

00:42.470 --> 00:47.470
And even this little gril thing I don't think we need to U-V map.

00:47.630 --> 00:54.630
But the other parts of the body the upper arm lower arm the leg pieces things like that.

00:54.710 --> 01:00.650
I'll probably go ahead and U-V map those just in case we need to add any scratches or dirt or anything

01:00.650 --> 01:01.760
like that.

01:01.760 --> 01:02.060
All right.

01:02.060 --> 01:04.600
Let's go ahead and work on the body here.

01:04.820 --> 01:14.600
So I'm going to go to my U-V editing view and I will isolate it and frame it up and let's take a look

01:14.600 --> 01:15.900
at this.

01:16.070 --> 01:22.220
I think first of all before I do this I'm going to turn off the subdivision surface modifier let me

01:22.220 --> 01:25.760
go back to the default view and turn that off.

01:25.790 --> 01:30.990
I don't think we need that on while we U-V map.

01:31.130 --> 01:35.920
So how should we U-V map this how should we break this apart.

01:35.930 --> 01:39.180
I think I'll select this edge here.

01:39.970 --> 01:44.140
And the corresponding edge over here and press control.

01:44.190 --> 01:49.130
And Mark seam I think we'll want to break those pieces out.

01:49.920 --> 02:01.280
As well as the leg joints down here of like this edge and all shifted this and control E and Mark seem.

02:01.340 --> 02:03.190
All right so we have those marks.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.920
But what about the rest.

02:05.940 --> 02:14.490
Let me hit the division key again on the numpad and it looks to me like what we could do is select edges

02:14.550 --> 02:23.730
that are covered up by the backpack here and then connect to those edges to the shoulders and the legs.

02:23.730 --> 02:26.340
So let's try that.

02:26.430 --> 02:38.610
I'm going to work with these edges here and then I think I will come this way toward that edge to that

02:38.610 --> 02:39.920
seam there.

02:39.990 --> 02:49.650
And I also want to come this way to this scene here and I'll mark this and let's take these seams here

02:49.680 --> 03:00.390
and go on a cross like we did and connect up to that scene and I'll mark that seam and then I'll take

03:00.390 --> 03:02.780
this seam down on this side here as well.

03:02.940 --> 03:08.430
And I'll also mark this seam right down here.

03:08.790 --> 03:13.230
So control and Mark seems so these are the seams I've got marked right here.

03:13.230 --> 03:14.280
Let's see if this works.

03:14.280 --> 03:21.510
My thought is is that it will split it out it'll break the back off right and it'll break the shoulders

03:21.540 --> 03:24.000
and the leg joints off.

03:24.020 --> 03:30.230
And then this middle piece will unfold out around that circular part.

03:30.420 --> 03:35.500
I'm going to select everything press the key and unwrap.

03:35.500 --> 03:42.780
I kind of like the way it's unfolding here and with the back as a separate piece but there's some problems

03:42.780 --> 03:49.970
here and I think I know what the problem is I think the problem is is we have some doubled up vertices

03:50.460 --> 03:53.970
and I'm not sure where they are.

03:54.180 --> 03:58.820
Maybe let's take one here and move it around.

03:58.830 --> 04:00.750
It's hard to know where they are.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.330
There it is.

04:02.340 --> 04:04.650
So let me.

04:05.040 --> 04:05.940
Here it is.

04:05.950 --> 04:12.710
So notice I've got two vertices right on top of each other here.

04:15.050 --> 04:15.580
All right.

04:15.610 --> 04:16.670
That's not good.

04:17.660 --> 04:20.910
And that's going to cause a problem with the use.

04:21.230 --> 04:29.640
What I need to do is remove those double vertices and luckily enough if I select everything and press

04:29.640 --> 04:39.320
the W key for the specials menu we have a tool called remove doubles so it'll just take any two vertices

04:39.320 --> 04:45.070
that are on top of each other in the exact same location and merge them into one.

04:45.230 --> 04:54.100
So let's run that and now let's select everything press the key and unwrap.

04:54.270 --> 04:55.510
There we go.

04:55.510 --> 04:57.330
That's a little better.

04:57.330 --> 05:02.370
That probably happened when we did the Boolean operation at the very beginning.

05:02.520 --> 05:06.790
So let's add a checker material to it.

05:06.810 --> 05:12.800
Pull this down and select the checker material and there we go.

05:12.810 --> 05:13.070
All right.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.530
Let's take a look at this piece here.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.030
I'm going to isolate it.

05:17.040 --> 05:24.340
So I think we should be able just to select everything press you and unwrap and then there you go.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.450
That's easy.

05:25.980 --> 05:27.280
How about the rim here.

05:27.330 --> 05:30.000
Is this something that we could unwrap fairly easily.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.800
Let's take a look.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.200
Let's isolate it.

05:32.220 --> 05:36.540
It is single sided So I think we could unwrap it pretty easily.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.220
Let's try this.

05:38.220 --> 05:42.420
Select everything press you and unwrap.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.450
Let's give it a checker material just to make sure

05:48.270 --> 05:50.190
it's actually not too bad.

05:50.310 --> 05:51.650
I think that'll be OK.

05:52.740 --> 05:53.880
All right.

05:53.880 --> 06:02.400
We should probably also give a check for material to this one as well to the cockpit glass just to make

06:02.400 --> 06:03.490
sure it's OK.

06:03.740 --> 06:04.130
Yeah.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.550
That looks good.

06:05.580 --> 06:06.480
The next piece.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.460
Let's take a look at the jet pack here.

06:09.480 --> 06:14.320
I'll isolate it and let's take a look at this.

06:14.370 --> 06:21.420
I think once again I will go and turn off the subdivision surface modifier for this particular one just

06:21.420 --> 06:25.300
for now turn off at least the visualization of it.

06:26.110 --> 06:29.450
And I'll go back to the editing.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.960
I think we could probably split this out here.

06:35.630 --> 06:44.060
Since we're probably not going to see that seam and we could probably split up these here we could probably

06:44.060 --> 06:47.370
put seams on this as well.

06:47.420 --> 06:50.960
Let's give that a try and see how that unfolds.

06:50.960 --> 06:58.880
I will mark seams and select everything and you and unwrap.

06:58.910 --> 07:00.650
There isn't a whole lot of stretching.

07:00.650 --> 07:03.780
Let's take a look at the checkered pattern.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.360
Well it's kind of pulling here though.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.210
I don't think that'll work.

07:09.940 --> 07:12.260
So let's see what else we can do.

07:12.300 --> 07:15.660
This has nonuniform scale.

07:15.660 --> 07:16.430
Let's try that.

07:16.430 --> 07:25.850
Let's press control a and apply the scale and then let's come back and try your U.V. mapping again.

07:27.270 --> 07:33.270
A little bit better but still these are kind of small here and this is kind of big here.

07:33.270 --> 07:34.710
It's kind of puzzling.

07:34.830 --> 07:38.690
I think we may have to put seams right out here.

07:40.290 --> 07:41.850
On the edges here let's see

07:44.510 --> 07:45.030
Mark.

07:45.060 --> 07:52.470
These seams and see how we're doing with this you unwrap.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.280
And are we doing here.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.740
That is quite a bit better.

07:56.750 --> 08:06.190
There's not as much stretching We do have more visible seams but that may be the price we have to pay.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.540
So we'll see how this works.

Well so far we've been dealing with objects here in Object mode.

00:05.250 --> 00:11.530
But the real power comes when you begin modeling things in edit mode.

00:11.550 --> 00:19.650
So if I go to Edit Mode down here I can see now the different components of the object.

00:19.650 --> 00:22.530
You can see these buttons down here.

00:22.530 --> 00:31.170
One is for selecting vertices one is for selecting edges and one is for selecting faces.

00:31.170 --> 00:37.780
Now if I come up here with vertex selection on I can click on one of these points and select a vertex.

00:37.890 --> 00:46.860
If I click on edges I can select an edge and if I click on faces I can select a face an easier way to

00:46.860 --> 00:52.290
select between these I think is with the control tab key combination.

00:52.290 --> 01:00.050
And when you hit control tab you get this mesh select mode menu so I can choose Virtex.

01:00.210 --> 01:03.100
And now I can select vertices.

01:03.210 --> 01:10.910
Now that I've got this selected I could press the G key and move it around like so I can use the manipulators

01:10.910 --> 01:12.120
to move it around.

01:13.140 --> 01:18.570
I could press control tab to go to the edge mode and move this around.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.410
And you can begin modifying your object

01:24.570 --> 01:27.580
now to get out of edit mode and back to object mode.

01:27.580 --> 01:36.310
You could of course go from edit here to object but you can also use the tab key tab from edit mode

01:36.910 --> 01:38.200
to object mode.

01:38.410 --> 01:46.630
And then once again to switch from Edge mode to face mode you can hit control tab and then select face

01:47.740 --> 01:57.680
and for each one of these components you can use the Move tool or the rotate tool or scale

02:01.740 --> 02:05.540
and transforming the components of the object is very important.

02:05.670 --> 02:11.370
But we're also going to need to be able to add new geometry to the objects to create whatever it is

02:11.370 --> 02:14.580
we're going to create to add new geometry.

02:14.580 --> 02:17.560
There are two tools I just want to mention here.

02:17.580 --> 02:23.460
At this point and these two tools will get you up and running with modeling almost anything you can

02:23.460 --> 02:24.540
imagine.

02:24.600 --> 02:31.030
One is the extrude tool and the other is the insert edge loop tool for extrude.

02:31.410 --> 02:37.260
Let's say I selected this face here and you can see over here in the Tools tab.

02:37.260 --> 02:45.660
When I'm in edit mode I've got this extrude extrude region extrude individual and I can choose any of

02:45.660 --> 02:50.170
those here but I can also hit the e key on the keyboard I think that's just easier.

02:50.260 --> 02:51.150
E for extrude.

02:51.150 --> 02:59.010
I'm going to hit that and that will allow you to then move the mouse and create new geometry off of

02:59.010 --> 03:00.830
that selected face.

03:00.850 --> 03:06.230
So when I click the left mouse button to confirm that operation.

03:06.470 --> 03:16.070
And now I can use any one of my transform tools like hit the s key for scale or change to my rotate

03:16.070 --> 03:21.550
manipulator and rotate it like this.

03:21.550 --> 03:26.610
So with the key it's very easy to just add new geometry to your objects.

03:30.620 --> 03:37.310
The other tool that's really important to get used to up front here is this loop cut and slide and the

03:37.490 --> 03:40.480
shortcut key for that is control are.

03:40.490 --> 03:47.270
So if I just wanted to extrude a small part of this face out I would need to actually insert an edge

03:47.270 --> 03:51.950
here to create a new smaller face to be able to do that.

03:51.980 --> 03:59.990
So if I press control are I can then hover over the object and see this kind of preview of where the

03:59.990 --> 04:02.160
new edge is going to go.

04:02.460 --> 04:09.680
If I hover over here and click once I can now insert that edge there and I can move the mouse around

04:09.710 --> 04:15.740
and drag it where I want it to go so say I want that edge to be right about here and I can click again.

04:16.190 --> 04:20.970
Now I've inserted a new edge here to create a new face.

04:21.080 --> 04:25.610
I'm going to press control tab to go to face mode and select that face.

04:25.610 --> 04:30.020
Now then I can hit the e key and extrude that out.

04:30.940 --> 04:37.870
So the insert edge loop tool allows you to create new edges which allows you to create new faces that

04:37.870 --> 04:40.570
you can then can extrude out of the object.

04:40.960 --> 04:47.800
So now I can hit the scale key and scale that end so I can go to the move manipulator tool and move

04:47.800 --> 04:48.490
that a bit

04:52.090 --> 04:53.260
so right up front.

04:53.320 --> 04:58.620
Those are the tools that we're going to be using to begin modeling Arsene.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.830
So in the next video that's exactly what we'll do.

05:02.180 --> 05:05.270
I think I'd like to begin modeling the Mac.

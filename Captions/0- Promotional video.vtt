WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:04.830
I do an Lisl blender foundation certified trainer.

00:04.830 --> 00:11.130
And I'd like to invite you to join me as we use Blender to create this animated scene of a mech descending

00:11.130 --> 00:12.580
into an underground tomb.

00:13.570 --> 00:20.210
As we go you'll be introduced to Blender's modeling tool set as we build the character and the environment.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.720
We'll talk about manipulating objects.

00:22.780 --> 00:25.570
The difference between object mode and edit mode.

00:25.720 --> 00:31.960
And as we begin modeling the Mac will discuss more advanced topics like cutting one 3D object with another

00:32.020 --> 00:33.280
using booleans.

00:33.280 --> 00:39.940
We'll talk about object origins and parenting creating geometry with the bridge tool and creating tubes

00:39.940 --> 00:46.660
or pipes with Bezier curves will create the elements of the environment the pillars the walls and we'll

00:46.660 --> 00:49.930
add more detailed scene elements along the way.

00:49.930 --> 00:56.950
Once the modeling is complete we'll talk about U-V mapping what it is why it's needed and how Blender's

00:56.950 --> 01:03.270
U.V. mapping tool set can help you U-V map your 3D objects quickly and efficiently.

01:03.310 --> 01:10.450
We'll take a look at Blender's cycles render engine as we add the materials for the Mac and the environment.

01:10.450 --> 01:17.350
We'll use the free open source image editing program gimp to prepare and edit our textures and apply

01:17.350 --> 01:20.670
them to the 3D models in the environment and on the Mac.

01:21.450 --> 01:23.890
Ultimately we'll want our character to move.

01:23.970 --> 01:30.330
So we'll go overpreparing the character for rigging creating the armature and how to set up an advanced

01:30.330 --> 01:38.700
foot roll rig will create custom shapes and make sure all our controls are parroted and organized ready

01:38.700 --> 01:45.640
for animating will begin animating our character flying into the scene and drop into the ground.

01:45.690 --> 01:52.410
We'll use Blender's graph editor and dope sheet to adjust the timing and we'll talk about key framing

01:52.650 --> 01:54.540
and tangents as well.

01:54.660 --> 02:00.060
Once our scene is complete and we've animated the character we'll do some final tweaks to the lighting

02:00.330 --> 02:07.260
as well as have some fun creating a jet flame effect for our MX's jet pack and in the end will render

02:07.260 --> 02:14.910
out the animation and export a movie file bringing an animated scene to life is an amazing process and

02:14.910 --> 02:19.230
once you know how to do it you can bring any of your ideas to life.

02:19.230 --> 02:21.810
So join me for mastering Blendr.

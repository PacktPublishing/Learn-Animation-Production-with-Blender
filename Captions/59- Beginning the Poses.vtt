00:01.130 --> 00:07.100
I've gone ahead and done a little tweaking to the animation I've kind of slowed him down as he's coming

00:07.100 --> 00:10.050
down through the ceiling here and let me play it.

00:10.100 --> 00:17.300
So he comes down and then he kind of hovers and then he kind of dips as he moves forward and then he

00:17.300 --> 00:18.980
drops.

00:19.330 --> 00:25.290
So that's what I've got so far and really it was just a matter of adjusting the curves.

00:25.690 --> 00:29.420
Tweaking the handles of each of the keys.

00:29.770 --> 00:36.640
At this point I think what I'd like to do is work on the rotation of him as he's coming down moving

00:36.640 --> 00:43.270
forward etc. I think I'd like him to come down pretty much straight up and down the way it is.

00:43.330 --> 00:49.600
But then as he begins to move forward I'd like him to kind of rotate forward as if the thrusters are

00:49.600 --> 00:51.170
kind of pushing him forward.

00:51.190 --> 00:55.340
And then as he comes to a stop I'd like him to rotate back a bit.

00:55.960 --> 00:58.140
So let's see if we can get that.

00:58.300 --> 01:05.920
I'll go back to the beginning here and I'm going to kind of turn like this just so I can see him a little

01:05.920 --> 01:07.760
bit better now.

01:07.810 --> 01:14.770
Hit play and I think so as he comes down I think this is OK but right here right here I'd like him to

01:14.770 --> 01:17.540
kind of roll forward just a bit.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.860
So he comes down.

01:19.870 --> 01:21.610
And then right here.

01:22.270 --> 01:25.450
Let's see if I can get him to roll forward just a bit.

01:25.450 --> 01:30.340
So I got in my rotation tool and I've still got autokey on.

01:30.340 --> 01:34.690
So before I begin a movement like this I've got a key the beginning state.

01:34.690 --> 01:40.980
In other words I need to key it say here like this or I'll hit.

01:41.050 --> 01:43.860
And for this I'll choose rotation.

01:45.150 --> 01:51.600
Now that's going to hold that position from the beginning here.

01:51.630 --> 01:53.430
Now if I move forward a bit

01:56.670 --> 02:00.450
go right here to frame 100 and I roll it forward some

02:03.230 --> 02:07.300
vs Now go back to the beginning.

02:07.310 --> 02:16.730
And so notice it's going to it's going to hold that upright position and then it'll turn and move forward

02:16.730 --> 02:17.980
like that.

02:18.140 --> 02:18.800
OK.

02:18.800 --> 02:30.650
And notice too that even after he tilts forward he'll move back up because at that he'll move back upright

02:30.680 --> 02:38.110
because at this keyframe we've got KEYES I believe for rotation here.

02:38.220 --> 02:41.250
So let's play this again and see how this looks.

02:41.250 --> 02:45.710
I think it kind of jerks forward a little bit too quickly.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.820
I want this to be pretty smooth.

02:48.060 --> 02:51.640
So let me take a look at the dope sheet here.

02:52.180 --> 03:01.080
If I scroll this down with the master control we can see that we've got rotation here.

03:01.660 --> 03:08.320
And notice I've got rotation over here so these are the keys that are driving it back upright.

03:08.320 --> 03:13.760
So by the time we get to hear these keys are telling it to be upright.

03:13.780 --> 03:23.290
So what I can do is for these keys here let me just check these so for these four I can delete these

03:23.290 --> 03:24.310
keys here.

03:26.930 --> 03:27.910
Let's try this.

03:27.920 --> 03:34.110
So I'm going to delete these keys and let's see if he turns back up again.

03:41.400 --> 03:44.010
He does but only because these are here too.

03:44.010 --> 03:49.420
So let me get rid of these.

03:49.410 --> 03:50.520
There we go.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.210
All right so let's play it again.

03:52.230 --> 03:59.730
He's going to come down rotate forward and he should stay rotated.

03:59.730 --> 04:00.170
Yeah.

04:00.340 --> 04:06.080
OK that's good because I want control over when he rotates back up right.

04:08.570 --> 04:09.720
All right.

04:09.720 --> 04:19.170
So I did say however that I thought the rotation was a little jerky here that it kind of moved too quickly.

04:19.170 --> 04:31.930
So I'm working with the X on this so for the X right here let me move this back some like so let's see

04:31.930 --> 04:32.940
how this works.

04:38.090 --> 04:40.160
I like that a little bit better.

04:40.240 --> 04:45.360
I'm going to move that forward just a little bit more and play that again.

04:50.800 --> 04:57.400
Yeah it looks like that the turn is part of the moving forward.

04:57.400 --> 05:01.960
Actually I'm going to take this and I'm going to move it forward just a couple more frames and see how

05:01.960 --> 05:02.990
that works.

05:10.990 --> 05:11.660
OK.

05:11.810 --> 05:14.870
So now he's got to turn back upright.

05:15.020 --> 05:22.970
So right in here I think as he comes up he's coming up just a bit I think right in here I'd like him

05:22.970 --> 05:27.130
to turn back upright.

05:27.590 --> 05:36.680
So if I want him to begin that at this point I've got to keep it here to hold that position from here

05:37.520 --> 05:38.780
to this point.

05:39.230 --> 05:45.400
So all I'm going to do is just take that keyframe and duplicate it and move it over to that point.

05:45.410 --> 05:52.990
Now that's going to hold that position now and move forward a bit here.

05:54.060 --> 06:00.880
And that's say at 165 that's where he's going to come back upright and do that.

06:00.880 --> 06:08.570
Let me just bring out my properties panel and in the rotation.

06:09.730 --> 06:10.980
Ax here.

06:12.890 --> 06:18.580
There is I think I'll take this back to zero like that.

06:18.950 --> 06:19.460
OK.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.600
So I'll hit in to close that.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.060
And let's take a look at this.

06:26.530 --> 06:30.360
He drops down rotates forward just a bit.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.500
And I think that's a little too quick.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.160
That's not quite organic enough.

06:41.970 --> 06:49.210
Well now that I play it again let me see.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.620
I feel like it's still a little too quick.

06:53.040 --> 07:01.380
Let me take this keyframe and move it back closer to here to give it more time to turn and I'll play

07:01.380 --> 07:01.790
that

07:10.040 --> 07:10.610
yeah.

07:10.660 --> 07:14.200
That works a little a little better I think.

07:14.200 --> 07:22.780
All right well the next thing I'd like to figure out is what he looks like how he's positioned as he's

07:22.780 --> 07:26.010
coming down into the scene.

07:26.350 --> 07:31.000
His arms and legs are just kind of the default positions.

07:31.180 --> 07:35.600
I feel like he should have a little bit more dynamic pose.

07:35.950 --> 07:43.090
So what I'm going to do is come back up to his beginning position here and I'll zoom in to him with

07:43.090 --> 07:50.650
the period key and I've got to figure out something where he looks a little bit more interesting than

07:50.650 --> 07:55.560
just this particular default pose.

07:55.720 --> 08:01.190
I'm going to start with the hands here and I'll just hit G and kind of move him up a bit.

08:06.490 --> 08:13.690
One thing I'm trying to do is make sure that I'm not doing the same exact thing on both sides of the

08:13.690 --> 08:14.200
character.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.230
I want him to be kind of asymmetrical in his poses.

08:22.300 --> 08:32.080
And for the fingers I'll deal with those on a last pass when the animation is pretty much all done.

08:32.410 --> 08:34.870
That kind of detail I'll save till the end.

08:36.360 --> 08:36.630
All right.

08:36.630 --> 08:39.230
Let's take a look at them with this pose.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.810
I'll hit the zero key just to get back to the camera view.

08:44.610 --> 08:45.350
And let's see

08:53.070 --> 08:54.480
right.

08:54.750 --> 08:57.580
That doesn't look too bad actually.

08:58.470 --> 09:02.330
He's going to need a new pose as he tilts forward.

09:02.340 --> 09:10.530
I think so if he comes down in this position then right about here he's going to have to change a bit

09:10.580 --> 09:19.620
and move his feet move his arms and then to a new position here.

09:19.710 --> 09:24.570
So let's see he's going to need to hold this position.

09:26.090 --> 09:30.410
Tell about right here.

09:30.490 --> 09:38.890
So I need to take all of these keyframes and move those so I'll hit the big key to border select all

09:38.890 --> 09:39.930
of these.

09:39.940 --> 09:46.440
So this is the arm and elbow and foot and the controls that I moved around.

09:46.480 --> 09:51.120
One thing I probably should do is establish a key frame for the other knee.

09:51.130 --> 09:52.650
Up front here.

09:52.810 --> 10:03.520
So why don't I go back to frame one and let's zoom in and just so I have that beginning keyframe So

10:03.520 --> 10:07.150
I've got one for the left leg.

10:07.150 --> 10:11.010
I'm just going to take this knee control and just tweak it just a hair.

10:11.230 --> 10:15.640
So I get an extra keyframe there so I get that keyframe.

10:15.670 --> 10:21.490
Now let's go back to the camera view.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.380
Play it.

10:22.480 --> 10:28.450
And I think he needs to come down and right about here is where

10:32.640 --> 10:36.900
those key frames should be copied to.

10:36.950 --> 10:46.460
So I'll select them shifty to duplicate and I'll drag the mouse forward to what is at frame 80 and we

10:46.460 --> 10:47.240
go.

10:47.630 --> 10:51.210
So that position will hold up to that point.

10:52.070 --> 10:53.740
Let's see what he should do now.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.040
If he drops down

11:01.080 --> 11:05.150
on like this and then move forward.

11:05.280 --> 11:18.820
OK so he as he comes down he should probably write about here one to those keyframes back

11:22.630 --> 11:24.650
to 75.

11:25.420 --> 11:35.710
And then as he comes back up like this to this point these feet I think should come down a bit because

11:36.180 --> 11:43.840
they're kind of kind of kind of dragged down so that secondary action of when the Met comes down and

11:43.840 --> 11:44.620
comes back up.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.790
Those feet will kind of drag or follow.

11:48.490 --> 11:52.700
So at this point move these down just a hair like so

11:59.050 --> 12:00.510
see how that works.

12:05.850 --> 12:11.590
So he is going to come down and those feet are going to kind of relax a bit like that.

12:12.980 --> 12:17.560
And they may even rotate a bit.

12:17.580 --> 12:18.150
Seeing

12:28.420 --> 12:34.150
so to change the start and end time here just because I want to play through it.

12:34.150 --> 12:47.870
Let's do it to let's say 50 from 50 to well let's see about 130.

12:48.330 --> 12:53.690
So I can kind of loop it at that from 50 to 130.

12:53.970 --> 13:01.830
So I will play.

13:01.890 --> 13:02.920
All right.

13:02.920 --> 13:08.590
It's not bad but I think those legs should come back as they come down.

13:14.780 --> 13:15.660
Take him back.

13:15.650 --> 13:16.360
Just bet

13:22.440 --> 13:23.010
that.

13:23.110 --> 13:24.330
Let's try that.

13:31.880 --> 13:38.190
Were all too much too quick I think me and you

13:41.870 --> 13:44.410
when we go to try that again.

13:48.980 --> 13:56.740
I'm going to switch to global mode here so I can pull these straight back just a hair.

13:56.930 --> 13:57.440
So

14:02.830 --> 14:04.130
that's a little better.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.220
All right.

14:11.230 --> 14:16.620
I think also I want to rotate the foot just a little

14:21.020 --> 14:29.060
like that.

14:29.270 --> 14:30.750
I'm going to go with that for now.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.570
I think there's more tweaking to be done there.

00:00.640 --> 00:12.150
Let's do the walls let's apply the scale for these press control a and scale same over here.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.080
I'll select one of these.

00:14.420 --> 00:15.940
Go to edit mode.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.310
Make sure it's selected.

00:18.350 --> 00:28.420
I'll press you and unwrap Now I'll come over here to the materials area and assign this checker material

00:29.590 --> 00:41.210
and then we go let's do that for over here you unwrap and assign the checker.

00:41.210 --> 00:46.510
Now for the floor I think it's going to need some more resolution.

00:46.700 --> 00:55.640
So I'm going to tap into edit mode and hit the W key and choose subdivide.

00:55.640 --> 01:01.130
And now I can bring this panel up over here and increase the number of cuts I'll just take it up to

01:01.130 --> 01:09.650
10 just so we have some more resolution in there because I think we may want to use the sculped tool

01:09.710 --> 01:12.580
to add some texture to this.

01:12.590 --> 01:20.060
So in Object mode I can see that the scale is non uniform so I'll go ahead and apply the scale here

01:21.080 --> 01:29.750
and I'll tab into Edit Mode press you and unwrap and then assign that Checker material.

01:29.780 --> 01:31.370
And there we go.

01:31.580 --> 01:38.480
The last piece of the puzzle I think is these beams we can work on one of these.

01:38.480 --> 01:47.600
Now I think we don't need a couple of faces here so if I go to face mode I don't think we need this

01:47.600 --> 01:48.680
face off on top.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.430
We're never going to see that.

01:50.810 --> 01:54.730
And I don't think we need this face back here either.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.040
I know we're never going to see that.

01:57.230 --> 02:01.130
So that makes it a little easier to unwrap.

02:01.350 --> 02:08.780
I'll go to edge mode and select these edges here and unwrap or scuse me.

02:08.780 --> 02:16.460
Mark seems there we can take a look at our scale and we can go ahead and apply that.

02:16.810 --> 02:24.070
And then in edit mode we can select everything press you and unwrap and then assign that Checker material

02:24.070 --> 02:28.620
just to see how we did.

02:28.990 --> 02:35.560
Well I've gone ahead and duplicated the pillars and beams on the ceiling but there's this one being

02:35.560 --> 02:39.620
here this shorter one that we should probably think about.

02:39.820 --> 02:47.530
I think I'll probably use the sculpting tools on this one to get this kind of jagged edge as if it's

02:47.530 --> 02:51.850
been broken off at the point where the hole in the ceiling begins.

02:51.850 --> 02:58.160
So I think for this I'm going to need to add a bit more subdivisions a bit more resolution.

02:58.330 --> 03:00.930
We just zoom into this real quick.

03:00.970 --> 03:05.140
Right now it's pretty low resolution there isn't much there.

03:05.150 --> 03:15.850
I'm going to press the W key and click subdivide and I'll add maybe maybe four cuts on it.

03:15.900 --> 03:24.300
So now what let's do is go to the U-V editing screen lay out we'll frame it up and take a look at it

03:24.300 --> 03:25.510
here.

03:25.680 --> 03:33.150
As we've established before we're probably not going to need the faces on the top when the press control

03:33.180 --> 03:43.110
up arrow to to make that view full screen or go to face mode and I'll start selecting these faces here

03:43.110 --> 03:54.110
up on top with the circle select tool and I'll delete those and I won't need the ones on the back either.

03:59.470 --> 04:01.050
Something like that.

04:01.360 --> 04:05.410
Pest Control up arrow again to come back to the screen lay out

04:08.420 --> 04:16.580
I can probably go ahead and apply my scale and then select everything in edit mode you and unwrap and

04:16.580 --> 04:17.520
let's see what happens.

04:17.540 --> 04:19.190
Oh well see what I've done here.

04:19.190 --> 04:26.660
I forgot to mark seems and so there's this polling that's happening up here so I should mark my seams

04:26.660 --> 04:27.920
here.

04:27.930 --> 04:38.380
I go to Edit mode and select and shift alt select these and control the and Mark seam.

04:38.490 --> 04:45.450
Now if I select everything and hit you and unwrap that should open that up a little bit so it doesn't

04:45.450 --> 04:52.980
stretch as much and I'll go ahead and apply the checker material to it just to make sure that there's

04:53.010 --> 04:56.090
no stretching there and it looks pretty good.

04:56.100 --> 05:02.950
The main thing we have to do is to use map the neck and we will work on that next.

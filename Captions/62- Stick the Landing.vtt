00:00.780 --> 00:03.750
So I've done a little more work on the drop.

00:03.750 --> 00:06.040
Let me just go ahead and play it from here.

00:06.390 --> 00:13.520
And what I did is I adjusted the curve of the y axis for the bone.

00:13.590 --> 00:17.220
So let's zoom in and take a look here.

00:18.000 --> 00:29.260
Let me go back I'm going to set my I'll start at 150 here set my range from 150 to to 50.

00:29.710 --> 00:37.990
And if we just play this you can see that he kind of drops a little more quickly and without a break

00:38.560 --> 00:42.880
from the top to the bottom of the movement here that foot still pops.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.610
But I'll work on that pretty soon.

00:45.610 --> 00:51.250
But my main concern was a direct drop from here down to here for the root.

00:51.250 --> 01:00.940
And one thing I did was I came in here to the y axis that up and down axis for the root bone and I changed

01:00.940 --> 01:08.410
the curve from the normal or the default of bezique yea to Lennier.

01:08.410 --> 01:16.690
So if I press the T key here you can see that I've got the ability to change the way the curves look

01:17.140 --> 01:26.110
but the default is bezier with the handles and I changed it to Lennier just so I'd have a straight line

01:26.230 --> 01:33.610
right down from the top of the drop to the bottom and I deleted all keyframes out of the middle.

01:33.610 --> 01:39.400
So we've got that straight drop from here right down to here.

01:40.980 --> 01:47.400
So what I need to do now is bring him back up into his standing pose.

01:47.610 --> 01:51.200
So he's dropped down here.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.980
Now he needs to stand back up.

01:54.070 --> 01:57.130
So we'll begin with the root bone here.

01:57.310 --> 02:05.230
And so he's dropped and maybe Let's see when he's going to stand up.

02:05.450 --> 02:11.430
Let me see.

02:11.510 --> 02:14.650
So maybe he begins standing up here.

02:16.950 --> 02:25.160
So I'm going to go ahead and ZERO him out in the wind so I'll press the key and choose the Y-axis and

02:25.160 --> 02:30.630
type in zero and bring him back up like this.

02:30.780 --> 02:37.230
That's not quite where he needs to be but I can just hit G and move him around so maybe he needs to

02:37.230 --> 02:42.470
be right around trying to find the center of gravity over those feet.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.610
Something like that Mary is.

02:46.010 --> 02:47.560
So let's see how that works.

02:52.650 --> 02:53.850
Not too bad actually.

02:55.890 --> 03:06.220
All right so now let's come to the point where he's fully stood up here and let's pose the arms so we'll

03:06.220 --> 03:10.070
bring the arms back down and rotate those hands.

03:11.920 --> 03:22.190
Yeah move the elbows out a bit like this and for this hand move it down and rotate that hand.

03:23.170 --> 03:39.670
And move that elbow out just a bit maybe the whole arm can come down a bit.

03:39.930 --> 03:41.760
All right let's see how that works.

03:49.420 --> 03:52.270
Yeah they need to come down quicker.

03:52.480 --> 04:01.090
So let's move these back see here the arms up here.

04:01.350 --> 04:03.180
So each one of these

04:09.150 --> 04:18.180
here they are so here's the left arm.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.800
Let's take this back.

04:20.910 --> 04:24.690
This and that works.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.830
Got a pop because of the elbow there.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.380
But just the speed of it.

04:36.390 --> 04:38.070
Isn't too bad.

04:38.070 --> 04:42.210
So I'll find Here's the right arm.

04:42.300 --> 04:45.280
Let's drop that one down a little quicker and see what happens.

04:49.230 --> 04:50.930
Will too much.

04:51.380 --> 04:52.870
Take that move forward.

04:58.170 --> 04:58.740
Not bad.

04:58.740 --> 05:06.640
I'm going to move forward two more frames.

05:07.010 --> 05:15.660
I feel like I want to try dropping him down just a hair more at the bottom of his drop.

05:15.660 --> 05:23.520
I feel like that he maybe should go down just a tad bit more just a hair and I don't know how much this

05:23.520 --> 05:33.330
is going to screw it up so save it and then pull him down a bit like a see if that does anything at

05:33.330 --> 05:33.920
all.

05:38.160 --> 05:38.400
All right.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.830
Let's do it from the beginning again here.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.500
Go back to the beginning and let's hit play.

05:44.850 --> 05:46.020
Actually you know what let's do.

05:46.040 --> 05:52.860
Well I'll hit Control up arrow to make this full screen and then I'll hit the zero key to view it through

05:52.860 --> 05:54.190
the camera view.

05:55.470 --> 05:59.350
All right so I'll press Alt A to begin the playback.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.260
Yeah I think the arms are a little bit.

06:12.460 --> 06:15.280
Stay a little bit too high.

06:15.280 --> 06:20.080
They don't need to be that high when he hits the ground but other than that everything's looking pretty

06:20.080 --> 06:20.810
good.

06:23.330 --> 06:23.660
All right.

06:23.660 --> 06:25.580
Well I will keep tweaking this.

06:25.580 --> 06:33.440
There are a couple of things I see that I could work on in addition to the hands but in the next video

06:33.440 --> 06:39.680
will work on animating him looking around the scene and animating the spotlight.

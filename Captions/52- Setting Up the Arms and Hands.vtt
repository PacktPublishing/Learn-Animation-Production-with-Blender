00:00.540 --> 00:04.320
Let's now set up I.K. controls for the arms.

00:04.320 --> 00:07.250
So let's zoom in here.

00:08.070 --> 00:18.360
And what I want to do is in a similar way to the feet I need to copy this hand bone to create the arm

00:18.430 --> 00:20.210
I.K. bone.

00:20.220 --> 00:24.950
So with this selected press shift D and hit enter.

00:25.050 --> 00:35.760
And now this all change to arm I K L and remember that we need to disconnected or clear the parenting

00:35.760 --> 00:42.470
information from this because it's still a child of this bone and parent of all of these.

00:42.630 --> 00:51.280
So I'll press Allt P and clear parent and now want to go back to pose mode and select this lower arm

00:51.280 --> 00:52.060
bone.

00:52.060 --> 00:58.930
And now we need to create an eye K-8 chain with two bones lower and upper and we need to target it to

00:58.930 --> 00:59.850
that arm.

00:59.900 --> 01:08.320
I.K. So with this selected I'll come over here to the bone constraints and add an inverse kinematics.

01:08.320 --> 01:13.050
I will target the armature and the bone is going to be that arm.

01:13.090 --> 01:20.380
I K.L. the chain length needs to be to and there we go.

01:20.390 --> 01:29.390
So now I should be able to select this arm I.K. bone and hit G and move it around.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.090
So there is the arm.

01:32.150 --> 01:39.690
Now once again the hand bone is not following the I.K. target.

01:39.800 --> 01:52.610
So I need to fix that so I'll select that hand bone and I will create a copy rotation I'll choose the

01:52.670 --> 01:56.050
armature and I'll pick that arm.

01:56.060 --> 02:06.170
I.K. And now we should be able to select that I k bone move it around and now the hand should follow

02:06.170 --> 02:08.300
along with that I.K. bone.

02:08.300 --> 02:16.370
So I'll hit our twice to go into rotation here and you can see that it's following along.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.350
All right.

02:17.650 --> 02:26.080
So I'll select all the bones and press alt are to clear the rotations and G to clear the transformations

02:26.170 --> 02:28.570
or the location.

02:28.590 --> 02:29.290
All right.

02:29.290 --> 02:32.500
So let's do that over here on the other side as well.

02:32.620 --> 02:43.040
I'll go back to edit mode and select that hand bone duplicated and let's rename that arm.

02:43.040 --> 02:55.900
I k r I will clear the parent with Allt P and now if we go back into PPOs mode select that lower arm

02:56.020 --> 03:05.600
and choose our inverse kinematics we will target the armature and that arm I.K. on the right and we'll

03:05.610 --> 03:08.510
increase the chain length to.

03:08.520 --> 03:16.920
So now if we choose that arm I.K. are should be able to hit the key and move the arm around.

03:17.230 --> 03:21.380
The only thing left for this is to do that copy constraint.

03:21.400 --> 03:33.870
So it's like the hand go to the copy rotation like the target that arm I.K. and there we go.

03:34.300 --> 03:40.690
So I'll say like the are my kid again just to test and sure enough it follows along.

03:40.690 --> 03:42.140
All right.

03:42.310 --> 03:49.300
So we've got inverse kinematics set up for our arms while we're doing this why don't we create elbow

03:49.300 --> 03:51.160
controls as well.

03:51.160 --> 03:55.570
So I'll go back to edit mode and select this elbow.

03:55.700 --> 03:56.610
I'll press shift.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.580
Yes.

03:57.820 --> 04:04.640
Move the cursor to selected all de-select everything and press shift a and there is that bone.

04:04.840 --> 04:13.150
This one we will go to my move tool and I'll move this straight back like this.

04:13.150 --> 04:23.840
And this is going to be our elbow control so we'll call it elbow C L L.

04:23.910 --> 04:30.600
Now we need to go back to pose mode and Slyke that lower arm and remember we're going to use the pole

04:30.630 --> 04:39.030
target for this so all Slyke the armature and select this bone which is going to be elbow control.

04:39.050 --> 04:39.880
Here it is.

04:40.230 --> 04:47.910
And of course the elbow pops around a bit but we can fix that by using our pole angle and bring it back

04:47.910 --> 05:00.150
around so it points at that control object or that bone or something like that and we go.

05:00.170 --> 05:06.250
So now if we grab this bone and move it around you can see it's moving the elbow around as well.

05:06.260 --> 05:12.980
Now for the foot we parroted the knee control to the foot control but I'm afraid if we do that to the

05:12.980 --> 05:19.150
hand control here we'll get some strange reactions when we actually rotate the hand.

05:19.220 --> 05:26.910
I think probably the better way to do it is to just parent it to the body for now so I'll select that

05:26.930 --> 05:30.850
and press control P and keep offset.

05:30.860 --> 05:37.460
So now if we go back to pose mode I can move this around you can see that elbow control moves along

05:38.120 --> 05:38.860
with it.

05:39.140 --> 05:47.350
But also we can move this down say and then grab that elbow control and move it around here.

05:49.650 --> 05:50.330
OK.

05:50.670 --> 06:00.390
So just like everything with the achy and press alt g to clear the location Allt are to clear the rotation.

06:00.390 --> 06:07.380
Now for the fingers I think what I'd like to do is create a system where we only have to move one bone

06:07.380 --> 06:18.720
at a time for each finger so instead of having to rotate this and then rotate this and then rotate.

06:18.720 --> 06:27.000
This what I'd rather do is just rotate one bone and have all the others rotate along with it.

06:27.120 --> 06:31.960
So I'm going to select everything and press alt are to clear the rotations again.

06:32.040 --> 06:41.670
So what we can do for that nego and press in to close that panel what we can do is create copy constraints

06:41.670 --> 06:42.880
from here to here.

06:43.080 --> 06:51.120
And from this joint to that joint so all we have to do is move this one and everything else bends along

06:51.210 --> 06:51.920
with it.

06:52.940 --> 06:59.060
So I'm going to turn on the names here so I can see what the names are.

06:59.220 --> 07:00.180
And we go.

07:00.430 --> 07:06.610
So what I'm going to do is create a copy rotation constraint from here to here so I'll select this finger

07:06.610 --> 07:16.150
index three and go back to my bone constraints Panel Add a copy rotation I'm going to only want to have

07:16.150 --> 07:20.420
this move in the X and I'm going to want it to be in local space.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.450
I'll choose the armature.

07:23.450 --> 07:35.810
And for this I want finger index 2 on the left you know like that so that if I choose this bone and

07:35.810 --> 07:42.670
rotate it you can see that other one rotates along with it.

07:43.090 --> 07:43.970
All right.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.530
Now let's do that again for this one.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.900
Index to copy rotation.

07:50.900 --> 08:03.390
Turn off y and z set these to local grab the armature and we want this to be finger index one and we

08:03.390 --> 08:04.120
go.

08:04.440 --> 08:11.480
So now if we just select this one finger and rotate it in the x.

08:11.880 --> 08:15.600
The other two joints come along with it.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.790
They rotate as well.

08:17.850 --> 08:26.550
So that's really all I'm going to need for this particular animation is just a little bit of finger

08:26.610 --> 08:28.770
movement like that.

08:28.770 --> 08:35.160
So what I need to do now is go through the rest of the fingers here creating copy rotation constraints

08:35.580 --> 08:38.340
from one to the next.

08:38.340 --> 08:42.660
Now as I've been working here I've noticed a bit of a problem I think.

08:42.780 --> 08:50.450
Notice how each one of these will rotate in the x or red X is here.

08:50.480 --> 08:54.810
All right we've got those all all lined up and for the thumb.

08:54.810 --> 08:56.180
These are OK.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.260
They're lining up in the X.

08:58.260 --> 09:00.450
But notice the tip of the thumb.

09:01.770 --> 09:03.780
The rotation is off.

09:03.780 --> 09:06.140
So I'm going to need to fix that.

09:06.150 --> 09:16.290
The problem is as I already have this object parent to that joint so I'm going to have to and parent

09:16.620 --> 09:21.080
that object fix the bone and then repair the object.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.820
Let's take a look at how we might do that.

09:24.240 --> 09:29.940
I'm going to come over here to the armature panel and turn on axes.

09:29.940 --> 09:32.490
I'll turn off names for a minute.

09:32.530 --> 09:38.610
And as it turns out you can see the problem here the z is pointing to the side and the X is pointing

09:38.610 --> 09:39.410
down.

09:39.540 --> 09:43.400
I need to rotate this 90 degrees here.

09:43.500 --> 09:47.750
But before I do that I'm going to need to and parent to this object.

09:48.060 --> 09:54.060
So let me go back to object mode and select this piece.

09:54.110 --> 09:58.800
What I'll do is press alt P and clear the parent information here.

09:58.820 --> 10:06.940
So now if I go back to pose mode on this and move this around it should not affect that.

10:06.950 --> 10:08.430
OK that's good.

10:10.540 --> 10:20.390
So now what I need to do is come in here to edit mode and use and the properties panel use the role

10:20.390 --> 10:21.840
field here.

10:23.130 --> 10:32.800
To roll this this way so that the z is pointing down like all the others something like that.

10:35.080 --> 10:43.760
All right so now what I can do is go back to object mode select this piece Schiff's select.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.520
Oh I need to go to pose mode.

10:45.520 --> 10:54.860
Scuse me I need to go a pose mode so that I can now select this shift select that bone in pose mode.

10:56.230 --> 11:00.270
And then control P and parent it to the bone.

11:02.680 --> 11:08.750
So now if we rotate in the X we should see that that joint rotates properly.

11:08.770 --> 11:12.550
So now I can go ahead and do the copy rotation for that.

11:12.550 --> 11:24.960
Over here in the constraints panel copy rotation and we'll go ahead and set these up local space armature

11:25.050 --> 11:33.580
and we will target the finger from two dot L.

11:33.880 --> 11:38.280
So hopefully now that should rotate properly when we rotate here.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.070
Yeah that looks good.

11:41.410 --> 11:49.360
All right we've just about set up the rig for the Mac what we need to do now is to create control objects

11:49.660 --> 11:55.960
so that when we animate the character we don't have to actually select the bones.

11:55.960 --> 12:03.940
We can hide them and just have control objects that will make our view cleaner and easier to handle.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.550
So that's up next.

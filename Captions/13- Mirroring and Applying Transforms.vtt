WEBVTT

00:00.920 --> 00:04.760
So now we're seeing our character kind of come together here.

00:04.760 --> 00:10.250
One thing I'd like to do before I begin detailing this before we actually begin going in and adding

00:10.250 --> 00:18.050
cleaner edges and smoothing the objects and getting them really detailed what I'd like to do is mirror

00:18.050 --> 00:26.800
these pieces over to the other side just so I get a sense of how it's going to look when we've got all

00:26.820 --> 00:28.720
the arms and legs on.

00:28.730 --> 00:33.170
So let's talk about using the mere modifier to do this.

00:33.260 --> 00:38.210
We used it earlier on but now we're going to use it in a little bit different way.

00:38.210 --> 00:40.760
Let's first work on the body here.

00:40.760 --> 00:45.830
I'm going to select the body and what we need to do is Mayre over these pieces.

00:45.950 --> 00:49.980
The shoulder joint here and the leg opening here.

00:50.150 --> 00:53.930
I want to mirror these pieces over to the other side.

00:54.320 --> 01:00.620
To do that we're going to have to delete half of this and this happens a lot in character modeling as

01:00.620 --> 01:06.830
you kind of have to get comfortable deleting half and marrying and then working on one side and then

01:06.980 --> 01:09.290
deleting half again and mirroring.

01:09.470 --> 01:14.410
It's a process that often has to be done several times during the creation of a model.

01:14.450 --> 01:18.560
So let's go ahead and do this to isolate this object.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.200
There are a couple of ways to do that.

01:20.360 --> 01:26.000
But how many do it here is to press the division key on the numpad.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.390
It's kind of a backslash.

01:28.550 --> 01:36.350
So I'm gonna hit that and that will isolate the selected object and then I can hit it again and everything

01:36.350 --> 01:37.440
else will come back.

01:39.160 --> 01:43.060
Now what I want to do is select the half that I want to get rid of.

01:43.060 --> 01:47.410
So I'm going to press the one key and the five key to go to the front.

01:47.410 --> 01:56.590
Orthographic view and the Z key to go to wireframe and then I'll tab into edit mode and use control

01:56.590 --> 01:59.680
tab to go to face mode.

01:59.680 --> 02:09.640
Now I can use the border select with the key and click and drag and get this half selected.

02:09.640 --> 02:14.250
Now I'll hit the x key and delete face's.

02:14.310 --> 02:17.000
So now I could mirror this over.

02:17.010 --> 02:23.040
The problem is that let's take a look at where the pivot point is or where the origin of the object

02:23.040 --> 02:23.750
is.

02:23.910 --> 02:30.280
When we use the mirror modifier it's going to try and mirror the object around the origin.

02:30.300 --> 02:36.930
So for this one if we use the mirror modifier it would try and mirror it around this piece here or around

02:36.930 --> 02:38.220
this spot here.

02:38.430 --> 02:45.510
We need to move the origin not just the pivot point but the origin to the center of the object or more

02:45.510 --> 02:48.270
easily to the center of the grid.

02:48.270 --> 02:54.990
Now this is one place where I think Blendr really shines in that you can move the pivot point and the

02:55.050 --> 02:57.960
origin of the object independently.

02:57.960 --> 03:03.180
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to press shift s and move the cursor to the center of the grid.

03:04.020 --> 03:07.420
And then I'm going to come over here to the Tools tab.

03:08.270 --> 03:10.660
And use this set origin.

03:10.670 --> 03:18.350
Pull down menu and change the origin to the 3D cursor and that pops that down into the center of the

03:18.350 --> 03:19.340
grid.

03:19.340 --> 03:25.810
Now when we mirror this it will mirror across your mirror at that origin point.

03:25.970 --> 03:30.650
I'm going to press the End key to take a look at the properties panel too.

03:30.990 --> 03:41.630
Oftentimes if we have rotation on our object we can get some strange behavior when mirroring our objects.

03:41.630 --> 03:47.180
I'm not exactly sure what will happen here but let's give it a try just to prove our point.

03:47.420 --> 03:56.630
I'm going to click the Add modifier and click mirror and you can see now that because of our rotation

03:57.620 --> 04:02.260
this mirror is not exactly the way we'd want it to be.

04:02.300 --> 04:08.370
So let's get rid of the mirror modify our here by hitting the x key.

04:08.390 --> 04:16.430
Now with this object selected in Object mode let's press control a and we get this apply transformation

04:16.640 --> 04:17.480
menu.

04:17.570 --> 04:25.590
So I'm going to apply the rotation and scale Currently I'm going to do that so that will zero out the

04:25.590 --> 04:30.880
rotation and take the scale back to 1.

04:30.940 --> 04:35.990
Now let's try the mirror modifier So I click add modifier and mirror.

04:36.230 --> 04:38.620
That looks a little better.

04:38.630 --> 04:43.720
So now what that's done is it brought over these pieces over to the other side.

04:43.730 --> 04:50.420
Now let's do this again for say the arms here for the time being I think I'm going to combine all the

04:50.420 --> 04:55.030
objects of the arm so I can mirror it over easily.

04:55.040 --> 05:02.270
Ultimately these pieces are going to be broken up into like the upper arm this piece and the shoulder

05:03.080 --> 05:13.900
and also the forearm and the elbow will be one piece and then the hand will be a single piece and then

05:13.960 --> 05:17.560
the fingers will be printed to the hand.

05:18.160 --> 05:21.070
But for now I'm going to just select all of these

05:24.170 --> 05:31.610
I'm going to press the Z key here and press the B key and border select this area so I can select all

05:31.610 --> 05:33.200
of those.

05:33.230 --> 05:36.610
Now that all of those are selected on press control J.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.450
And that will make them all one object.

05:40.460 --> 05:46.760
Now once again the pivot point or the origin of the object is in the wrong place so I'll press shift

05:46.820 --> 05:53.690
s cursor to center and then set origin origin to 3D cursor.

05:53.690 --> 05:59.480
Now when I add that mirror modifier it will mirror over to the other side.

05:59.590 --> 06:03.050
And now we're beginning to get a sense of how this is going to look.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.970
But let's do the same thing for the leg here.

06:06.030 --> 06:15.960
I'll select all these objects press control J and then set origin to the 3D cursor.

06:15.960 --> 06:20.730
Now I'll add the mirror modifier and look at what happened.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.640
The leg mirrored around the wrong spot.

06:23.640 --> 06:24.780
Why did it do that.

06:25.020 --> 06:26.790
Well take a look at the rotation.

06:26.850 --> 06:30.530
We've got 90 degrees in here so that isn't going to work.

06:30.540 --> 06:39.900
I'm going to hit the X to delete the mere modifier and let's hit control a and apply our rotation and

06:39.900 --> 06:41.590
scale.

06:41.630 --> 06:47.740
Now that we've cleaned up these values let's add the mere modifier again.

06:49.510 --> 06:57.890
And then we go so now that we get a sense that this is kind of working for us I think now we'll begin

06:57.890 --> 07:04.130
working on actually detailing the character and breaking it apart and organizing it for the rigging

07:04.130 --> 07:04.800
process.

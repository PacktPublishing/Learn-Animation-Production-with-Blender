00:00.770 --> 00:01.100
All right.

00:01.100 --> 00:03.530
So that's our finger joint here.

00:03.830 --> 00:09.950
What I'll do with this now is I think I should be able to take all of this if I select all of these

00:09.950 --> 00:15.880
pieces go to my move tool press shift D and then click.

00:15.920 --> 00:20.470
And now I can move these over and there's our next joint.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.860
And one last joint.

00:21.860 --> 00:29.450
I'm just going to select this one cube and press shift D and click and move it to the end.

00:29.450 --> 00:31.780
I think I'm going to adjust this a bit.

00:31.790 --> 00:39.140
I'd like to go into edge mode by hitting tab and going to control tab and then pressing the two key

00:39.140 --> 00:40.830
to select edge mode.

00:41.060 --> 00:42.860
I'm going to pull this in just a bit.

00:42.860 --> 00:45.930
So this is the tip of the finger.

00:46.580 --> 00:56.120
What am I to do is combine this part of the finger first some a select all of these pieces and to join

00:56.120 --> 01:00.530
these objects together into one I'm going to press control J.

01:00.920 --> 01:04.270
And now that joins this whole piece into one object.

01:06.520 --> 01:11.700
So I'm going to call this I'll call this finger three.

01:11.830 --> 01:18.520
And then I want to do the same thing for this I'm going it's like this and shift's select these and

01:18.520 --> 01:20.470
press control J.

01:20.470 --> 01:23.550
And for this I'll call this finger two.

01:24.310 --> 01:30.950
And this piece up here I'll call finger one.

01:31.420 --> 01:32.500
All right.

01:32.920 --> 01:36.070
So now each of these pieces is its own object.

01:36.070 --> 01:42.080
And now what we want to do is be able to rotate around this joint right here.

01:42.130 --> 01:49.720
So if I selected this object to zoom in here and tab into edit mode and hit a to d select everything

01:49.970 --> 01:56.150
what I need to do is select this piece just this piece and I'm going to snap the cursor to it.

01:56.290 --> 02:02.200
So I'm going to hover over one of these edges and if you're in face mode you only need to hover over

02:02.200 --> 02:04.930
one of the little dots on the object.

02:05.080 --> 02:10.810
So I'll hover over one of those and I'm going to press the L key to select the linked components of

02:10.810 --> 02:11.710
that object.

02:11.710 --> 02:13.110
So it's only going to select.

02:13.120 --> 02:22.990
Now that cylinder press shift s and I'll move the cursor to selected and that will snap the cursor to

02:22.990 --> 02:24.840
the center of that object.

02:25.360 --> 02:33.630
So now if I take this object and move its pivot point to the cursor that's where it will rotate from.

02:33.640 --> 02:44.200
So I'm going with this selected in Object mode select Tools and go to set origin and origin to 3D cursor.

02:44.200 --> 02:49.890
Now if I go to the rotate tool and rotate this it rotates at that joint.

02:49.930 --> 02:52.370
So let's do the same thing to this one now.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.640
So I will go into edit mode.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.150
De-select everything.

02:57.160 --> 03:05.440
I will hover over that cylinder and press the L key and then I'll press shift s and cursor to selected.

03:05.440 --> 03:14.380
Now if I go back to object mode and click Set origin and origin to the cursor now it too will rotate

03:14.380 --> 03:15.490
around that point.

03:16.870 --> 03:23.770
Lastly let's do the same thing over here to this one except this time I'm going to select one face here

03:23.770 --> 03:33.880
at the back and then press shift s cursor to selected and then set origin to 3D cursor.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.600
So now this one rotates back here.

03:37.600 --> 03:42.310
This one rotates back here and this one rotates back here.

03:42.310 --> 03:48.670
Now ultimately we'll rig these so that won't be quite as important as to where the pivot point is.

03:48.690 --> 03:55.090
But for now I just wanted to show you the logic behind rigging these fingers.

03:55.090 --> 04:02.890
So now what we can do is parent this to this and this to this.

04:03.160 --> 04:11.860
So what let's do is select the tip shift select the middle of the finger and press control P to bring

04:11.860 --> 04:16.210
up the parent menu and we're going to parent to object.

04:16.690 --> 04:23.410
So now if we just select that middle finger and rotate it it'll bring the tip of the finger along.

04:23.530 --> 04:28.670
And in addition if we select the tip we can rotate it from there as well.

04:29.980 --> 04:39.400
And I'm going to select the middle finger chefs select the finger one press control P and select object.

04:39.400 --> 04:48.710
So now if we rotate around here we can rotate around here and rotate around here right.

04:48.780 --> 04:55.620
All right so now let's bring that other layer back by pressing the shift key.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.870
And that first layer.

04:58.230 --> 05:05.850
And you noticed that the fingers kind of big and that's ok I can hit the s key and scale it down and

05:05.850 --> 05:10.110
the move to move tool and begin moving this into place.

05:13.680 --> 05:20.740
So as I said I'm going to move this right up into the sphere kind of like this and for now I'll go ahead

05:20.770 --> 05:23.450
and rotate these just to see how they look.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.050
Something like that.

05:30.650 --> 05:40.950
So now that I have this one in place I'm just going to select these and duplicate it with shift D.

05:41.180 --> 05:43.760
And now I'm going to move these into place

05:46.790 --> 05:52.550
here's the new one here and I'll move this one into place so this one's a little going to be a little

05:52.550 --> 05:55.350
smaller as the index finger.

05:55.460 --> 06:05.560
I think I'd like to rotate it so and once I rotate it now it's probably going to be easier to put it

06:05.560 --> 06:14.650
into place in local transform mode here so going to go down here to the global pull down menu and switch

06:14.680 --> 06:17.820
the transform orientation to local.

06:17.920 --> 06:22.940
And now I can rotate these a little easier and place them a little easier I think

06:28.340 --> 06:38.000
now I think I'll switch back to global mode and select this one again and duplicate it with shift D

06:39.020 --> 06:44.220
and move it over for the Pinki.

06:44.330 --> 06:50.690
I'm going to just select that top part of the finger and then hit s and scale it down a bit and maybe

06:50.690 --> 06:54.270
I'll switch back to a local mode to put it into place.

06:58.320 --> 07:05.890
And lastly I'll grab this middle finger again and go back to global mode.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.310
And one way to do that is to press the alt spacebar and that'll bring up the orientation menu.

07:13.440 --> 07:22.160
So I'll switch to global again and I'm going to go ahead and duplicate click and then move this finger

07:22.220 --> 07:25.050
around here so that it's the thumb

07:28.700 --> 07:32.770
and I'll hit the alt space again to go to local orientation.

07:33.590 --> 07:42.510
And work on this a bit and as I'm twisting this I've got some weirdness happening with the rotation.

07:42.640 --> 07:50.470
What I need to do is just select that top bass part of the finger and then rotate from there and I should

07:50.470 --> 07:53.640
get a better orientation.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.870
And I think for the thumb I'm actually going to thicken it out.

07:58.990 --> 08:03.870
So it's a little bit thicker than the rest.

08:03.930 --> 08:10.690
The last thing I'll do here in this video is maybe work on this upper arm I'm not real happy with this.

08:10.830 --> 08:16.920
And also Idda it appears that the forearm to me may be a little bit too short.

08:16.920 --> 08:26.390
So a couple of things here let's work on first of all I think what I want to do is select these fingers

08:27.560 --> 08:35.160
and the hand so I'm going to select finger one and these as well as this fear.

08:35.170 --> 08:39.670
I believe the spheres the hands that change that to have and in the outline are here.

08:39.820 --> 08:47.230
So I know what things are and this is why you begin labeling things up front because as your scene gets

08:47.230 --> 08:54.730
more and more complex it gets harder and harder to keep track of what things are so select these fingers

08:55.480 --> 09:02.110
and the hand and I'm just pressing the shift key and clicking on the individual elements here.

09:03.240 --> 09:08.050
And what I'd like to do is bring this hand down some.

09:08.170 --> 09:12.500
I feel like I feel like it needs to be a little bit farther down.

09:12.700 --> 09:20.250
Oh and look as I moved this how they move in a very strange way that's because they're moving in their

09:20.550 --> 09:21.890
local axes.

09:22.050 --> 09:28.280
So I'll hit control or command Z to undo and I'll switch over to global.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.950
Now I should be able to move these straight down.

09:31.260 --> 09:35.670
So I feel like maybe the arm needs to be about that long.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.090
I need to stretch this arm down.

09:39.090 --> 09:44.600
But what I want to do is scale it from the top here so I'll hit tab to go into edit mode.

09:45.060 --> 09:47.740
And now I'm going to press on it and so like this edge.

09:47.970 --> 09:55.710
And once again what I'm going to do is place the cursor cursor to selected and now when I go back to

09:55.710 --> 10:04.380
object mode what I can do is change my pivot point now from median to 3D cursor and if I choose that

10:04.380 --> 10:12.810
3D cursor now I can scale from the point of the 3D cursor keeping the elbow in place and moving this

10:12.810 --> 10:15.720
down to encompass the hand.

10:16.170 --> 10:22.720
So for this I think I'll go into edit mode and press control r and I want to insert a couple of edge

10:22.740 --> 10:29.160
loops here and I could just click once here to insert this edge loop and then do that do the whole process

10:29.160 --> 10:29.730
again.

10:29.790 --> 10:34.380
But you can also scroll the mouse wheel here to add edge loops.

10:34.560 --> 10:40.780
So I'm going to scroll the mouse wheel until I get to three edges and then click and then click again.

10:40.950 --> 10:49.200
And now I'm just going to use these edges press alt and click this edge begins nailing these out.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.550
But look at what I'm doing.

10:50.550 --> 10:55.650
I'm actually scaling from the cursor so I don't want to do that.

10:55.800 --> 11:02.370
I'm going to come back here to the pivot point and change that pivot point to the median point again.

11:02.430 --> 11:08.670
And now when I select that edge and hit the esky I can scale that out a bit so I'm going to just scale

11:08.670 --> 11:20.140
these out a bit to make that a little bit more beefy.

11:20.150 --> 11:20.880
There we go.

11:21.730 --> 11:23.440
Something like that.

11:23.470 --> 11:27.730
All right in the next portion of the course we'll begin working on the legs.

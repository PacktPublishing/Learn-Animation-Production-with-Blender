00:00.920 --> 00:08.580
Now let's think about creating a panel here on the back some sort of panel with buttons and lights and

00:08.580 --> 00:11.170
things like that that can go on the back here.

00:11.430 --> 00:19.310
To do that I think I'll just go to a new layer and I think I'll create a cube.

00:20.100 --> 00:27.630
So I'll take this and kind of shape it the way I think it might need to go I think I'll do a rectangular

00:27.630 --> 00:30.350
panel here.

00:30.660 --> 00:33.840
I don't need the bottom face once again.

00:38.630 --> 00:48.170
And maybe I'll just select this face on top and extrude and then click and then scale it in a bit and

00:48.170 --> 00:50.350
then extrude and pull downs.

00:50.510 --> 00:58.010
So we've got a little inset panel there and I'll go ahead and add a subdivision surface modifier

01:01.390 --> 01:10.500
and I'll smooth it and let's see about adding some edge loops here.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.070
I'm going to add two edge loops.

01:13.070 --> 01:27.320
Scale them out like so and add two more along here and scale them out to hold the corners and we go

01:28.580 --> 01:34.230
and maybe I'll do two on the rim here.

01:36.460 --> 01:38.590
And maybe two along the side

01:42.540 --> 01:45.410
and scale those out.

01:45.410 --> 01:54.880
All right so now we have a panel that we can use to set our buttons and things.

01:55.310 --> 01:57.220
Let's create a light.

01:57.380 --> 02:04.440
So to create a little light I'm going to begin with cylinder.

02:04.660 --> 02:15.340
I'll take this down to 12 and I don't need any capful for this.

02:15.580 --> 02:17.160
Scale it down.

02:17.920 --> 02:31.120
And all I'm going to do is just take this top edge here scale it in a bit extrude and scale in extrude

02:31.600 --> 02:33.500
and move down.

02:37.130 --> 02:40.110
And then maybe scale into hair here.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.310
So there's the edge of it.

02:43.400 --> 02:53.840
Maybe I'll scale that out a bit more and now I can place a sphere in there a U.V. sphere and scale it

02:53.840 --> 02:54.550
down.

02:56.350 --> 03:03.130
I could always isolate this and get rid of half of it.

03:03.130 --> 03:04.680
I don't need all of this

03:08.750 --> 03:14.630
so I could border select the bottom part here and delete faces

03:19.970 --> 03:21.790
and bring that back.

03:22.190 --> 03:28.140
And then we can go ahead and combine these two objects with control J.

03:28.700 --> 03:36.410
We could add a subdivision surface modifier and now we could add a few edge loops.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.880
So let's drag this up

03:44.850 --> 03:47.450
and there we have a light.

03:47.460 --> 03:52.460
Now we could move this over put it in place

03:55.960 --> 04:04.530
so maybe it's some sort of a blinking light on the back of his jetpack here.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.490
So we can put that in place for now.

04:08.800 --> 04:13.030
Something like that and then how about a button.

04:13.150 --> 04:17.070
We might as well create some sort of a button.

04:18.540 --> 04:27.260
With say cylinder we could add the Caps fill back in with the triangle fan.

04:28.560 --> 04:35.780
I should probably delete these I'll go ahead and add a subdivision surface modifier to

04:41.420 --> 04:43.070
add a few edge loops.

04:45.610 --> 04:50.800
Now let's move this one over into place and see how that looks.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.970
We've got some sort of a button.

04:54.370 --> 04:56.070
We'll put that in place.

04:56.080 --> 05:02.730
I'm not sure where that's going to go and we'll just duplicate these to arrange our panel.

05:03.280 --> 05:09.980
And lastly I think I want some sort of rectangular item as well.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.690
I'll create a cube.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.350
Delete the bottom face.

05:19.110 --> 05:29.730
And also for this we'll probably want to subdivide this as well so I'll add a subdivision surface modifier.

05:29.790 --> 05:32.010
Go through the same process here.

05:35.540 --> 05:37.580
Add a few edge loops

05:45.810 --> 05:49.780
and maybe one or two along here.

05:53.010 --> 05:58.320
OK so there is our rectangular button thing.

05:58.860 --> 06:06.040
So now we have a couple of items that we can play with here.

06:06.180 --> 06:13.530
So what I'll do now is go to the top view and orthographic view and wireframe and just begin figuring

06:13.530 --> 06:23.430
out what I'm going to do with these I think first of all I'll duplicate this and maybe this can be some

06:23.430 --> 06:28.090
sort of a longer panel here.

06:28.110 --> 06:32.190
Maybe we need a light up here.

06:32.430 --> 06:34.110
I don't know something that could blink

06:38.320 --> 06:39.870
something like that's

06:42.820 --> 06:43.190
all.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.280
Take this and move it up here as well.

06:48.730 --> 06:58.720
And then over here we can have a few more little blinking lights type thing and maybe we need one more

06:58.720 --> 07:02.350
of these appear so it's just however you want to do it.

07:02.350 --> 07:10.050
I'm just making something that looks as if it has some sort of purpose something like that.

07:11.720 --> 07:23.420
So that'll be our panel and I'll just select everything in control J and then that will all call this

07:25.310 --> 07:32.060
panel and I'll set the origin to the center of this geometry.

07:32.630 --> 07:41.390
And now if we take a look at everything I get to bring the layers back by pressing shift and click and

07:41.390 --> 07:43.140
there is our panel.

07:43.580 --> 07:47.860
I will rotate it 90 degrees

07:50.480 --> 07:54.220
negative 90 around the X..

07:54.920 --> 07:57.410
Now let's come back here and put it into place.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.080
Now of course it's a little big

08:04.340 --> 08:15.470
0 0 it out in the x I might want to take these edges here and move them back a bit something like that.

08:20.870 --> 08:21.570
And there we go.

08:21.570 --> 08:27.250
Now we've got some sort of panel that just kind of hints that extra detail there.

08:27.250 --> 08:33.120
All right well it looks as if the mech is getting pretty close to being done now.

08:33.220 --> 08:40.730
I think all we need to do is mirror these pieces over and then we begin modeling our environment.

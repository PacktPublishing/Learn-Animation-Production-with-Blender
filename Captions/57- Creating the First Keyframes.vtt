WEBVTT

00:00.740 --> 00:07.010
Let's begin creating our first keyframes to move the Mac down into place for something like this I'd

00:07.010 --> 00:08.570
like to begin with the end.

00:08.570 --> 00:18.400
In other words I want to keyframe the MEK back here somewhere on the timeline and then also keyframe

00:18.410 --> 00:21.080
the mech at its beginning point.

00:21.170 --> 00:24.200
So I know I want to end here.

00:24.740 --> 00:31.240
That's not a question and I'm thinking that and this is just a guess at this time.

00:31.520 --> 00:36.980
I'm thinking that the Meck will take about eight seconds to come down through the hole in the ceiling

00:37.430 --> 00:39.260
and land on the ground.

00:39.350 --> 00:45.840
It will then kind of take a look around maybe take a step or two and then the scene will end.

00:46.130 --> 00:51.090
So I'm thinking maybe eight or nine seconds to get down into the room.

00:51.560 --> 01:00.350
So I'll come maybe to frame 200 here once again this is just a guess and we can adjust the timing at

01:00.350 --> 01:01.550
any point.

01:01.880 --> 01:06.500
I'll select that Master Control which is somewhere around it.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.520
You're going to have to press the Z key to get to that.

01:09.530 --> 01:15.530
So I'll select that and I'll hit the Z key again to come back out of wireframe.

01:15.530 --> 01:20.690
So now that that's selected I want to insert a key frame at that point so to do that I'm going to press

01:20.690 --> 01:31.700
the key and I'm going to insert a key frame for the location of the Mac the X Y and Z of its location.

01:31.850 --> 01:35.690
So I click that and notice what it does.

01:35.690 --> 01:45.170
It creates a key frame over here and it also puts a key frame here on the graph editor at frame 200.

01:45.170 --> 01:45.800
All right.

01:45.800 --> 01:54.380
So let's go back to frame zero now and I'm going to zoom out and I want to move the mech now up to where

01:54.380 --> 02:01.400
I think he should be at the beginning of the animation so I'm using that master control to move him

02:01.400 --> 02:06.530
around move all of the control objects around at once.

02:06.860 --> 02:12.790
So knowing full well that we can adjust this at any point in time I'm going to go ahead and set it keyframe

02:12.800 --> 02:13.400
here now.

02:13.430 --> 02:18.030
So I'll press the key and location.

02:18.370 --> 02:22.610
So you can see now that I've got two key frames here.

02:23.400 --> 02:27.120
One at frame one and one at frame 200.

02:27.150 --> 02:29.180
I've got two frames in here.

02:30.390 --> 02:33.070
He open this up just a little bit more here.

02:34.540 --> 02:42.430
I've got one key frame at frame 1 and one at 200 and you can see it's created this kind of smooth curve

02:42.970 --> 02:44.070
between the two.

02:44.070 --> 02:50.740
Keyframes So let me just press control up arrow here and make this full screen.

02:50.740 --> 02:59.860
And if we roll the master control down here we can see we've got X Y and Z and you can see by the color

02:59.860 --> 03:03.470
that this curve is the curve of the y axis.

03:03.520 --> 03:11.950
This is the curve of the Z and The X is in here because I didn't move it at all in the X the X at frame

03:11.950 --> 03:18.250
1 is zero and the X at frame 200 is 0 as well.

03:19.790 --> 03:25.730
So I'll go ahead and press control up here again to make that screen smaller again.

03:25.730 --> 03:28.100
And now if we hit play let's see what happens.

03:32.370 --> 03:40.290
So you can see it's moving down in the seen down from above the ceiling down to the floor.

03:40.290 --> 03:42.200
Now it's moving pretty slow.

03:43.290 --> 03:48.990
You can see here that the frames per second is only around 10 or 12.

03:48.990 --> 03:53.310
I'd really like to see this more at 24 frames per second.

03:53.430 --> 03:55.410
So I'll go ahead and hit pause here.

03:56.920 --> 04:04.440
And if I click and drag on this cursor in the timeline I can click and drag it back and forth and you

04:04.440 --> 04:08.220
can see the map coming down into place.

04:08.460 --> 04:16.500
So as I'm playing the scene you can see that the frame rate is hovering around 14 or 15 or actually

04:16.500 --> 04:23.020
10 or 12 as the comes down into the scene and that's being caused by a couple of things.

04:23.280 --> 04:29.460
One I think the main reason is that there are just so many polygons in the scene and there are so many

04:29.460 --> 04:36.650
polygons in the scene because we've got the multi resolution modifier on quite a few of the objects.

04:36.660 --> 04:45.990
So what I'd like to do is remove the or at least turn off the multi resolution modifier on many of the

04:45.990 --> 04:48.450
objects while we're animating.

04:48.510 --> 04:50.550
So a couple of them.

04:50.580 --> 04:52.810
One is this floor here.

04:52.860 --> 04:56.760
So if I select the floor I'm going to turn on the Select ability here.

04:56.940 --> 04:58.530
Select the floor.

04:58.530 --> 05:06.450
And if I go to my multi resolution modifier I can turn that off with the I button here I can do the

05:06.450 --> 05:08.470
same thing for the ceiling.

05:08.610 --> 05:15.810
I'll scroll back up and turn that back on for just a moment click that and turn the multi resolution

05:15.810 --> 05:17.360
modifier off there.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.340
Let's go back and see how we're doing on the frames per second.

05:20.340 --> 05:28.880
Now click the play button and now we're up to like 18 13.

05:28.950 --> 05:32.270
So let's take a look at the mech.

05:32.280 --> 05:36.740
Now let me move up here and I'll zoom in to this guy.

05:36.840 --> 05:42.900
So for the Mac we've got quite a few pieces that have the multi resolution modifier on them.

05:42.900 --> 05:45.560
The fingers don't so we don't have to worry about that.

05:45.870 --> 05:53.670
But if I roll out to the armature item in the outliner if I click on the plus there you can see that

05:53.670 --> 06:01.140
all of the objects are underneath the armature that everything's printed to it.

06:01.170 --> 06:11.710
So let's scroll down and for the arms we could select the arms and and disable that modifier so I'll

06:12.280 --> 06:13.160
kick the.

06:13.290 --> 06:17.490
And we'll do that for these.

06:17.490 --> 06:21.480
It looks like one of my arms is not named properly.

06:21.480 --> 06:25.650
It looks like the left lower arm needs to be re named.

06:25.650 --> 06:28.790
I'll work on that here in a minute.

06:29.460 --> 06:40.790
If we scroll down below the fingers we can see that maybe the feet we could disable the multi resolution

06:40.790 --> 06:43.280
modifier for those.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.540
Maybe the hands

06:48.030 --> 06:53.540
and I'm going to have to go back and turn these back on before we render the scene.

06:53.700 --> 07:01.380
But just to clean up the viewport here so are frames per second is a little bit closer to 24 frames.

07:01.380 --> 07:07.790
I'll do the same for the legs and the mech body.

07:07.820 --> 07:08.180
All right.

07:08.180 --> 07:16.130
So let's go back into our scene here and let's hit the play button and see how this works.

07:16.130 --> 07:19.500
So come down in here and hit play.

07:19.750 --> 07:24.200
And it looks like we're getting a pretty solid 24 frames per second now.

07:24.520 --> 07:30.970
So that's just going to help us figure out the timing as we're animating.

07:31.340 --> 07:35.510
So let's place a keyframe in the middle of these two keyframe.

07:35.510 --> 07:44.960
So if I hit the play button I'm going to let them come down here and maybe what I'm thinking is that

07:45.050 --> 07:52.640
instead of coming down in a straight line like that that kind of drops down into the scene hovers for

07:52.640 --> 07:56.710
a minute moves and then drops in the center of the grid.

07:56.750 --> 08:02.760
So instead of coming down at an angle like that I'm going to take this and move it over a bit so it's

08:02.770 --> 08:05.780
straight down below the hole.

08:06.930 --> 08:11.950
And then insert a key frame here with the key and location.

08:12.420 --> 08:20.230
And you can see here in the graph editor that it's created a new key frame right there at frame 122.

08:20.310 --> 08:24.390
So I'll go back to the beginning hit the play and let's see what happens here.

08:24.390 --> 08:30.890
So now he comes down like this to here and then moves forward like that.

08:31.030 --> 08:32.470
All right.

08:32.470 --> 08:42.360
So instead of coming at an angle from here to here I think at this point I'd like him to be hovering

08:42.360 --> 08:44.520
right over that hole.

08:44.610 --> 08:46.410
So I'll move him forward.

08:47.940 --> 08:52.080
And insert a key frame here with the Ickey.

08:52.240 --> 08:56.230
And now let's go back and play that comes forward.

08:56.240 --> 09:03.280
Then he comes down into the hall and then he moves forward a bit like that.

09:03.330 --> 09:04.180
All right.

09:04.930 --> 09:13.730
So I think I'd like him to instead of coming at an angle from here to here.

09:13.960 --> 09:22.590
I'd like him to move forward in the y axis between here and here.

09:23.480 --> 09:29.210
So I think something like let's move him forward.

09:31.540 --> 09:35.050
And then up a bit.

09:35.110 --> 09:35.460
All right.

09:35.470 --> 09:41.920
So now we've got four key frames we can see them here.

09:41.970 --> 09:43.250
I'll go back to the beginning.

09:43.250 --> 09:48.660
Hit play and now he moves forward and then drops down through the hole.

09:49.640 --> 09:54.610
And moves forward again and then drops down.

09:54.690 --> 09:58.140
So notice now that it didn't create a keyframe here.

09:58.140 --> 10:04.360
I didn't hit the key to create a key frame so I'll move this forward again.

10:05.400 --> 10:10.720
And what I'd have to do is then drag this into place again and hit the Ickey.

10:10.980 --> 10:13.340
But I don't always remember that.

10:13.770 --> 10:20.380
So Blendr has a nice little feature here and every 3D animation program has this.

10:20.790 --> 10:23.120
I'm going to turn on auto keyframe.

10:23.280 --> 10:32.970
So every time I make a change to the animation to the animated objects here it will insert a key frame

10:33.030 --> 10:33.800
for me.

10:33.900 --> 10:44.530
So I'm going to turn that on and now if I bring this down to about where I want it to hover like this

10:45.860 --> 10:53.030
I'll bring it down to 160 say now I'm going to move it forward and back up again and look at what's

10:53.030 --> 10:53.950
happening.

10:54.020 --> 10:58.930
It's creating keyframes automatically every time I make a change.

10:58.940 --> 11:01.720
So now let's go back hit the play.

11:02.030 --> 11:09.570
So now he drops down to the whole moves forward a bit and then drops down like that.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.900
Now the timing I think is pretty slow and floaty.

11:15.030 --> 11:19.020
There's not a lot of speed change or differentiation in the movements here.

11:19.020 --> 11:24.320
So let's begin adjusting our timing and to do that.

11:24.330 --> 11:31.680
I'm going to use the dope sheet up here so if I go back to the beginning again and hit play coming down

11:31.680 --> 11:32.930
to the scene that's not bad.

11:32.930 --> 11:37.580
I don't mind that although I think it could happen a little bit quicker.

11:37.740 --> 11:44.190
So maybe I'd like to get to this keyframe to this point a little bit quicker in the animation so I can

11:44.190 --> 11:51.480
select this keyframe here and then I'm going to press the G key and just move it back on the timeline.

11:51.480 --> 12:01.980
So maybe he comes down to that point by frame one hundred instead of frame 122.

12:01.980 --> 12:02.370
All right.

12:02.370 --> 12:04.560
So I've moved it back there.

12:04.920 --> 12:08.040
Let's play that and see how it works.

12:08.100 --> 12:08.780
He comes down.

12:08.790 --> 12:13.980
He drops down into the room and then he begins moving forward like that.

12:14.190 --> 12:24.300
And then he drops down right now when he comes down here to this point I'd kind of like him to come

12:24.480 --> 12:27.750
up a bit before he drops down.

12:27.750 --> 12:36.590
So at frame 80 I'm going to take him up just a little bit like this and maybe over here.

12:38.220 --> 12:42.150
At one hundred I'll take him down just a bit.

12:42.150 --> 12:45.460
See how that works.

12:45.470 --> 12:49.020
So if I hit play he comes down into the scene

12:52.750 --> 12:55.180
moves forward and then drops down.

12:55.420 --> 13:03.590
And I'm thinking maybe he turns off his thrusters to make that drop.

13:03.620 --> 13:09.360
I think I'm going to bring that down just a little more at frame 100.

13:09.380 --> 13:12.280
So it comes down like this.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.150
Let's try that

13:17.990 --> 13:24.480
and maybe he dips down a bit between frame 100 and frame 180 maybe 140.

13:24.500 --> 13:28.520
He can dip down just a little bit as he's coming forward.

13:28.550 --> 13:32.260
Let's try that and I'll hit the play.

13:32.300 --> 13:35.110
So he comes down into the scene.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.680
And his back up just a bit and then drops.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.640
I don't think the timing is quite right on that.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.280
We'll have to keep working on it.

13:44.380 --> 13:52.870
But this is a general process I'll be using blocking out the main broad animation first and then going

13:52.870 --> 13:58.430
in and adjusting for the smaller movements the smaller details.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.650
So in the next video we'll work on fine tuning the animation some.

00:00.780 --> 00:07.110
For the beams on the ceiling I think we can probably just give it that sandstone texture and be done

00:07.110 --> 00:07.810
with it.

00:08.130 --> 00:09.710
Let's take a look.

00:09.750 --> 00:17.610
I'll grab one of these beams and maybe go into the editing view and isolate this.

00:17.610 --> 00:24.540
So for this we can do a very similar thing that we did before we can just bring in a texture coordinate

00:25.530 --> 00:31.520
we can bring in with Shift A The image texture node.

00:31.740 --> 00:39.990
We can hook up the U-V know to the vector input and the color to the color and then click open and bring

00:39.990 --> 00:42.930
in that sandstone seamless texture.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.290
So there it is.

00:46.650 --> 00:54.040
It's once again looking a little big for the object in the properties panel here.

00:54.040 --> 01:00.370
I'll go into the texture window and change the scale maybe increase this to 3.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.690
See how that works.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.500
Actually let me try for here let me try one more.

01:07.090 --> 01:08.830
Yeah I'm going to go with four.

01:09.250 --> 01:20.390
And so now I can bring in a new image node and I'll change this from color to non color data and I'll

01:20.390 --> 01:24.240
open in the textures folder.

01:24.410 --> 01:28.410
I'll grab that sandstone seamless bump.

01:28.660 --> 01:36.690
And then with that I'll bring in a bump node under vector here.

01:39.560 --> 01:48.150
Bring the color into the normal and the normal into the displacement and then I'll also increase the

01:48.150 --> 01:51.210
scale here to 4 as well.

01:51.540 --> 01:57.230
Something like that so let's go back to the default view.

01:57.350 --> 02:02.790
Take a look at that that looks pretty good.

02:02.870 --> 02:09.260
We'll go with this until we get the final lighting and then we may adjust the scale or something like

02:09.260 --> 02:10.540
that.

02:10.610 --> 02:15.710
I think I want a different color along this sculpted area.

02:15.860 --> 02:25.830
I think I want it to be a darker kind of rock so I will go back to the U-V editing view.

02:27.450 --> 02:30.640
And as it turns out it's got the same materials as the walls.

02:31.020 --> 02:36.920
I think we should probably go ahead and give it its own material so I'll add a new material slot.

02:37.790 --> 02:42.840
And the new material to the slot are called the ceiling.

02:43.620 --> 02:48.410
And then I'll get rid of the walls.

02:48.430 --> 02:51.450
Let's take a look at the U-V map real quick.

02:53.150 --> 03:04.760
I'll go into edit mode and with everything selected we can see this U-V map and this right here this

03:04.760 --> 03:10.650
piece right here is that edge of the hole that I was talking about.

03:10.700 --> 03:16.760
So my thought is I would try and add rock type texture here.

03:16.850 --> 03:25.070
So with all of these selected I'm going to go to Uvas and export you lay out and the ceiling is actually

03:25.070 --> 03:27.730
going to be fairly big in the scene.

03:27.920 --> 03:35.970
So I think what I'm going to do is increase the image size from 10:24 to 2048

03:40.360 --> 03:47.550
and sense our resolution size is going to be 12:3 by 720 and that ceiling is going to take up a good

03:47.550 --> 03:49.940
part of the image.

03:50.130 --> 03:56.260
I'm going to make it fairly big so that the textures don't get pixilated and blurry.

03:56.430 --> 04:02.400
So I'll call this one ceiling Uvas and export it.

04:02.430 --> 04:05.610
And now let's go take a look at it in Gamp.

04:05.610 --> 04:14.640
So in Gamp I'll go to a file and open and in my images folder I'll take a look for that ceiling Uvas.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.400
Here it is.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.240
And I'll open that.

04:17.580 --> 04:23.100
Now for this I can once again put that sandstone texture on here I can probably use that.

04:23.190 --> 04:25.050
So I'll go ahead and open that up.

04:26.250 --> 04:30.840
And in my textures I'll use that sandstone seamless

04:35.730 --> 04:46.470
and now select it with command a copy with command C and then I'll put it over here with command V and

04:46.470 --> 04:50.700
to anchor that floating selection I'll go ahead and click a new layer.

04:51.180 --> 05:02.710
I'll go ahead and scale it down some with the scale tool and I'll click and go and scale it down a bit

05:04.790 --> 05:14.070
I'll move this layer down beneath the Uvas and I'll go to the moved tool and I'll move this down so

05:14.070 --> 05:17.210
it covers up that area.

05:18.520 --> 05:21.250
Now this may need to be pretty small and repeat.

05:21.250 --> 05:24.260
Let's see what we can do here.

05:30.050 --> 05:33.980
Go I'll duplicate this layer

05:36.940 --> 05:38.360
move that down.

05:39.550 --> 05:43.780
Go now for this top part.

05:43.990 --> 05:51.040
I think I'm going to have to take a look online and see if I can find some sort of a rock cliff kind

05:51.040 --> 06:02.900
of texture so to do that I'm going to go to Google here and I'll type in rock cliff texture and see

06:02.900 --> 06:03.920
what happens.

06:05.430 --> 06:15.630
Click images and search tools are good size and large and let's try something like let's see what we

06:15.630 --> 06:16.540
have here.

06:18.150 --> 06:19.930
Here's one that's not bad.

06:20.280 --> 06:24.470
Let's try this.

06:24.480 --> 06:29.070
So back in Gamp I'll go ahead and open that image.

06:35.100 --> 06:42.840
I only need a part of this so I'll go over here to the rectangle select tool and just drag an area out

06:42.840 --> 06:43.790
like this.

06:45.630 --> 06:57.770
And I'll press control or command see go back to my Uvas and for this press command the and to make

06:57.770 --> 07:04.570
this floating selection a new layer I'll just click new layer and then lets move this into place.

07:04.740 --> 07:14.570
I'll drag that down below all the other layers and let's just zoom in here and I'll scale this to fit

07:17.370 --> 07:18.930
see how this works.

07:21.730 --> 07:28.250
I might come in to the colors menu here and go to brightness and maybe brighten this up just a little

07:28.250 --> 07:28.830
bit.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.790
And we go let's try that.

07:35.090 --> 07:39.840
I'm going to press shift command J to frame everything up in the window here.

07:40.010 --> 07:42.260
Turn off the you Vees.

07:42.770 --> 07:46.910
So we don't get those in the image and then go to file export as

07:51.020 --> 07:56.830
and in the textures folder I'll save it as ceiling color and export

08:02.950 --> 08:09.670
back in Blendr Let's go ahead and add the nodes we need in the node editors so our press shift a and

08:09.670 --> 08:18.520
go to input and texture coordinate and then I'll press shift a and go to texture and image texture and

08:18.520 --> 08:23.450
I'll hook these up the Uvas to vector and the color to color.

08:23.680 --> 08:28.890
And then let's click open and find our texture in the textures folder.

08:28.900 --> 08:32.630
I'll grab that ceiling color and let's see how we did here.

08:34.460 --> 08:35.300
All right.

08:35.630 --> 08:43.350
So it's quite a bit different than the rest but let's see how we did.

08:43.350 --> 08:44.300
I don't know.

08:44.580 --> 08:47.230
I'll go to the default view here.

08:47.610 --> 08:52.000
And let's go to the camera view by hitting the zero key.

08:52.250 --> 09:03.400
And let's go ahead and go to the rendered viewport shading We'll work on balancing the colors of all

09:03.400 --> 09:04.770
the objects here.

09:04.840 --> 09:11.860
Once we get everything textured so let's go with this and then see how we're doing as we get closer

09:11.860 --> 09:13.830
to the final lining's set up.

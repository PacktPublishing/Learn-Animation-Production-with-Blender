00:00.660 --> 00:09.480
For the pillar camps here we can also bring in an image texture right within the properties window here.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.780
So let's try that.

00:11.780 --> 00:20.220
So I've selected one of the Pillar caps and I've got the material here and in the surface section below

00:20.220 --> 00:28.170
the diffuse here I'm going to select this button in the color channel and that'll give me this menu

00:28.640 --> 00:32.340
and I can choose image texture from the menu here.

00:33.610 --> 00:40.930
Now I've got the Open button here or the pull down menu and I can just pull the menu down and go ahead

00:40.930 --> 00:44.100
and choose that sandstone seamless.

00:44.230 --> 00:44.970
And there we go.

00:44.980 --> 00:47.710
That adds that to that material.

00:47.710 --> 00:55.130
Now I can come over here to the textures panel and down here under mapping I can change the scale to

00:55.160 --> 00:57.920
I don't know three maybe let's try that.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.700
That looks OK.

00:59.950 --> 01:07.690
Now one of the things I'm seeing here is repeating textures you can see that the textures here are exactly

01:07.690 --> 01:09.390
the same.

01:09.490 --> 01:11.770
There are a couple of ways to deal with this.

01:11.770 --> 01:14.830
I mean we could make these the raw material.

01:14.890 --> 01:22.390
Each one of these and then map it in individually and change up the scale and the rotation.

01:22.390 --> 01:30.130
We could try changing up the rotation here by rotating around the Z but that just does that all at the

01:30.130 --> 01:31.140
same time.

01:31.950 --> 01:34.920
So that's not quite what we want.

01:34.950 --> 01:42.120
One very quick option here is just to actually select kind of every other one of these and and rotate

01:42.120 --> 01:42.570
them.

01:42.780 --> 01:49.730
So here in the property panel I can maybe take this one the rotation and the Z zero.

01:51.610 --> 01:57.640
And that will spin that around a bit and maybe this one over here or maybe this one.

01:57.650 --> 02:02.230
I could take to 180 like that.

02:03.060 --> 02:08.000
And then maybe this one over here I could take back to zero.

02:08.490 --> 02:11.450
And this one over here maybe to zero.

02:11.520 --> 02:18.790
So that's just a quick way to provide a little bit of differentiation between each of those objects.

02:18.980 --> 02:20.980
Let's take a look at this back wall.

02:20.990 --> 02:23.180
What are we going to do with this.

02:23.180 --> 02:28.130
I thought it might be kind of fun to try and put some hieroglyphics on it.

02:28.160 --> 02:33.240
I did find an image out on the Internet with hieroglyphics.

02:33.410 --> 02:41.260
Let's go to the U-V editing view here and I'll go ahead and isolate that back wall.

02:41.590 --> 02:46.600
And if I go to Edit mode you can see that it's just one big plane.

02:46.720 --> 02:56.020
I'm going to go ahead and export this out go to Uvas an export U.V. layout and I'll export it as 2048

02:56.050 --> 03:01.110
because that's going to be fairly prominent in our scene and in the images folder.

03:01.150 --> 03:05.970
Go ahead and call this back wall.

03:06.230 --> 03:08.750
UVA's.

03:09.130 --> 03:12.740
And then in Ganpat go ahead and open that up.

03:12.820 --> 03:15.920
There they are back wall Uvas.

03:16.000 --> 03:24.010
So the first thing I'll do is open up that sandstone seamless that we have in our textures folder here

03:27.050 --> 03:32.440
and that's going to need to go right on top of here.

03:34.250 --> 03:49.120
Click new lair to anchor that and let's go ahead and scale it down.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.490
I'll drag that layer down to.

03:52.590 --> 03:55.200
So it's beneath the Uvas

04:05.600 --> 04:10.890
and I'll duplicate the layer and move that over

04:22.420 --> 04:26.750
now I'll open up those hieroglyphics and let's see how those work

04:32.510 --> 04:37.670
I'll copy those and paste those into here as well.

04:37.710 --> 04:38.050
Click.

04:38.050 --> 04:39.690
New Layer.

04:39.710 --> 04:45.440
Bring this down beneath the movies scale it down.

04:50.180 --> 04:51.050
All right.

04:51.050 --> 04:52.690
So I've got those in place.

04:52.700 --> 04:59.200
I think I need to take the opacity down on both of these quite a bit.

05:00.630 --> 05:09.710
And let's see if we can play with the blend mode here maybe let's try an overlay again.

05:10.950 --> 05:12.600
No I don't like that.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.100
Oh how about the dissolve.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.180
That's not bad.

05:17.300 --> 05:25.850
Let's try dissolve on both of these and then I'll bring the opacity down a little more and then what

05:25.850 --> 05:35.260
I'll do is I'll use the erase tool at a fairly low opacity come in here and just erase some of this

05:36.360 --> 05:39.940
for these.

05:39.940 --> 05:40.230
All right.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.300
Let's go and save this out and see how it works.

05:43.330 --> 05:45.490
I'll go to a file export.

05:45.910 --> 05:48.330
Put it in the textures folder.

05:48.340 --> 05:51.120
We'll call this back wall color

05:54.210 --> 05:55.650
and back in Blender.

05:55.650 --> 05:58.420
Let's go ahead and hook it up to our material.

05:58.620 --> 06:12.600
So shift a input texture coordinate shift a texture image texture and let's hook these up and go to

06:12.610 --> 06:25.710
Open to find that texture choose the back wall and then we go so let's see how it looks in the scene

06:25.710 --> 06:26.200
here.

06:28.740 --> 06:30.250
Well that's not too bad.

06:30.480 --> 06:35.240
Good or rendered viewport shading.

06:35.420 --> 06:38.250
And now everything is very dark.

06:39.080 --> 06:44.780
I think we're going to need to go through and adjust the color for each one of these maybe make them

06:44.780 --> 06:47.630
a little bit brighter.

06:47.650 --> 06:59.340
So what we can do is let's go over here to the compositing screen layout and I will for this viewport

06:59.350 --> 07:09.770
right here I'll press the 08 key to go to the camera view and go to the materials nodes over here.

07:10.730 --> 07:14.810
I'll swing this out and go over to the materials panel here as well.

07:16.450 --> 07:27.400
And I'll take this to rendered viewport shading here so we can kind of see the rendered view as well

07:27.430 --> 07:29.480
as the node editor.

07:29.740 --> 07:36.130
First of all for this wall I'm going to spread these nodes out a bit and what I want to do is add a

07:36.130 --> 07:43.040
node just after the image texture that allows me to adjust the color a bit.

07:43.390 --> 07:48.990
So to do that I'm going to press shift a and go to color and I'll choose this.

07:49.110 --> 07:51.230
RGV curves node.

07:51.580 --> 07:59.710
And that's this no I can drop it right in between those two and it'll hook it up automatically.

07:59.800 --> 08:08.260
And what this node will do is it allows you to adjust the curves for the red green and blue or all of

08:08.260 --> 08:09.250
them combined.

08:09.250 --> 08:16.630
And for me I think it's easiest to just work with them all combined and you can click in this view and

08:16.660 --> 08:24.780
add a point on the curve and that point on the curve will allow you to drag it up or down.

08:24.880 --> 08:30.780
And if you drag it up on this side it'll lighten up the color for that particular object.

08:30.850 --> 08:35.880
And if you drag it down over on this side it'll make it darker.

08:35.890 --> 08:43.980
So this is just an easy way to kind of adjust the brightness or the color of a texture song.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.540
Bring this up here.

08:46.390 --> 08:48.200
Lighten that up a bit.

08:48.640 --> 08:54.030
Once again you can hear the fan in my computer kick in as it tries to render this out.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.260
Let's try one of the pillars here.

08:58.320 --> 09:04.360
So for this one it looks like the color texture is here.

09:04.440 --> 09:09.980
So I think I could add a R.G. B curves node right in here.

09:10.020 --> 09:13.210
Press shift a color.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.570
RGV curves and drop that right in here.

09:18.140 --> 09:24.690
And now I can add a point and pull it up here.

09:26.090 --> 09:29.210
That should brighten those up just a bit.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.440
Let's do that for the floor.

09:34.460 --> 09:44.110
Here's our color Noad press shift day color R.G. B curves and drop it in and I'll try and brighten that

09:44.110 --> 09:44.850
up a bit.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.320
Maybe the ceiling as well.

09:57.000 --> 10:11.720
And the beams.

10:11.870 --> 10:18.190
So now for any one of these objects I have a lot more control over the color through this R.G. B curves

10:18.290 --> 10:22.320
node Well we're coming along.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.020
The textures are looking pretty good.

10:24.020 --> 10:31.330
There are some things I think I wouldn't mind working a little more on like the cliff rock part of the

10:31.350 --> 10:33.330
hole in the ceiling.

10:33.330 --> 10:37.580
I think I need to do a little bit more with the back wall.

10:37.590 --> 10:43.650
I don't really see the hieroglyphics too much and I may want to work on differentiating the colors of

10:43.650 --> 10:49.050
the beams and the ceiling a bit but overall I think it's coming together.

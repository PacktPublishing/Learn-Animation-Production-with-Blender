WEBVTT

00:00.950 --> 00:04.020
We now have our first object you've mapped.

00:04.040 --> 00:08.760
Let's take a look at it in the scene and see which way our seems are pointing here.

00:08.760 --> 00:16.610
I'll go back to object mode press the division key on the number pad and well actually let me go back

00:16.610 --> 00:17.590
to edit mode here.

00:17.600 --> 00:22.700
And this is the direction of our Uvas and that's not bad.

00:22.700 --> 00:29.910
I almost think we should face this part of the object out toward our scene.

00:30.260 --> 00:33.570
So I'm going to go back to object mode.

00:33.620 --> 00:41.900
I'll press the End key and go to my rotate to begin rotating around the z axis and it looks like I can

00:41.900 --> 00:45.780
just type in 90 in the z axis here.

00:46.700 --> 00:50.150
And then I'll press the End key again and that should.

00:50.300 --> 00:56.410
Yeah that gives us the least amount of seams pointing out into our scene.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.970
All right so that one's been U-V mapped.

00:58.970 --> 01:04.280
What I'd like to do real quick is go ahead and replace these with this one.

01:04.430 --> 01:11.360
I'll switch back to my default view and I'll zoom in to this one here.

01:12.990 --> 01:20.490
And what I'd like to do is just take this one and copy it and replace these others instead of me going

01:20.490 --> 01:24.640
through and U-V mapping each and every one of these.

01:24.930 --> 01:34.940
What I can do is just snap the cursor to the selected object then I can delete the object then I can

01:34.940 --> 01:44.270
take this one that's already been U.V. mapped duplicated click and then with shift Das moved the selection

01:44.510 --> 01:48.300
to the cursor and there we go.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.600
So now I'll take this one.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.700
Move the cursor delete it.

01:55.360 --> 02:03.130
Take this one duplicate click and move this to the cursor.

02:03.330 --> 02:05.790
So I'll just do that for the rest of these here.

02:08.900 --> 02:14.590
All right so now I have five U-V mapped pillar caps.

02:15.170 --> 02:21.380
Well now that we're here why don't we take a look at one of these pillars the pillars are of course

02:21.380 --> 02:23.240
more cylindrical.

02:23.240 --> 02:30.980
There are two pieces and also we need to make sure that our seams are back here in the back of the cylinder

02:31.370 --> 02:33.440
rather than appear in the front.

02:33.530 --> 02:41.750
So I'll go back to my U-V editing lay out and press the period key and then the division key on the

02:41.750 --> 02:43.340
number pad.

02:43.590 --> 02:47.940
And let's go ahead and go into it mode.

02:47.940 --> 02:55.650
We can see through this because there's this ghost image turned on here this sort of guy limit selection

02:55.650 --> 02:56.690
to visible.

02:56.700 --> 03:02.650
If I click that that will turn off that kind of transparent thing going on there.

03:03.180 --> 03:05.640
I kind of like it so I don't see through it.

03:06.490 --> 03:06.990
All right.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.970
So let's think about this how should we go about this if we just selected everything and hit the Yuuki

03:16.450 --> 03:17.930
and hit on RAP.

03:18.010 --> 03:19.680
That's what we get.

03:19.720 --> 03:25.540
So that's just pretty much all the polygons laid one on top of the other and that's not going to be

03:25.540 --> 03:27.060
very helpful.

03:27.190 --> 03:28.740
So we don't want to do that.

03:28.960 --> 03:39.730
Probably our best bet would be to mark seems first of all maybe along here someone a press option and

03:39.730 --> 03:46.840
select this edge and that will mark an edge all the way up to the top here so we can see what happens

03:46.840 --> 03:57.130
when we do this we can press control e Mark seam select just this top piece with the LTE and then press

03:57.130 --> 04:00.880
you and unwrap a little better.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.120
But there's still stretching up here and I think the reason why there is stretching is because we've

04:07.120 --> 04:10.220
got this cap on it.

04:10.510 --> 04:16.810
If I de-select this I'm going to select these two edges here here and here and on press control E and

04:16.810 --> 04:22.990
I'm going to choose clear seems so that will clear the seam from those two edges.

04:23.860 --> 04:29.460
What I think I'd like to do is split this top piece out from the rest of the column.

04:29.640 --> 04:38.080
So I'm going to select this top edge here and press control E and Mark seem.

04:38.170 --> 04:42.790
Now let's try this Amona once again hover over an edge press the key.

04:42.790 --> 04:50.710
So I just select the top part of the column I'll press you and unwrap Malik what is done it's split

04:50.710 --> 05:01.450
out that top piece here into it's own U.V. island which allowed this part of the pillar to be laid out

05:01.510 --> 05:05.530
in a much cleaner more flat kind of way.

05:05.530 --> 05:09.190
So it looks like we may need to do that with the bottom here too.

05:09.430 --> 05:15.530
Let's take a look to get access to that piece down there.

05:15.580 --> 05:17.450
What I'm gonna do is press shift.

05:17.470 --> 05:17.850
H.

05:17.860 --> 05:24.920
And that will hide all of the unselected pieces and now have access to this down here.

05:25.300 --> 05:28.640
And let's just split it out into its own U.V. shell.

05:28.690 --> 05:38.230
So I want to go to edge mode and select these two edges and press control E and clear seam and then

05:38.320 --> 05:49.440
I'm going to select this edge around the bottom here and I'll make that a seam with control E and Marxian.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.460
Now let's try this again.

05:51.510 --> 05:56.830
I'm going to select everything press you and unwrap.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.480
Now that looks better.

05:58.820 --> 06:09.020
Now we've split out the top and the bottom caps and now the pillar lays out in a more flat uniform way.

06:09.020 --> 06:14.740
Let's press alt h to bring back that other piece and let's take a look at this.

06:14.780 --> 06:20.030
So I'm going to hover over an edge press l press shift H.

06:20.140 --> 06:23.980
And then I'll press the period key on the numpad to zoom in.

06:24.080 --> 06:31.480
So I go to edge mode and select this edge with alt and select control.

06:31.530 --> 06:39.980
Easy Mark seem press alt and select that edge control the mark seam.

06:40.320 --> 06:47.550
And now since I've got a seam back here it's going to break up the sides and split it out and lay it

06:47.550 --> 06:48.530
out flat.

06:48.720 --> 06:56.870
Based on that scene so I'll select everything hit you and unwrap and that looks a whole lot better.

06:57.300 --> 07:01.620
So I'll press old H to bring back the other part of the pillar.

07:01.650 --> 07:04.160
Now here's the key to select everything.

07:04.440 --> 07:11.790
And here is a problem we now see that the U-V maps are the U-V islands of the two different parts of

07:11.790 --> 07:14.280
the object are overlapping.

07:14.400 --> 07:22.800
So we need to somehow figure out how to get these U-V Islands out so they aren't on top of each other.

07:22.800 --> 07:30.270
Now one thing I could do is come down here to the U-V islands select and I can click on one that I could

07:30.270 --> 07:37.960
hit the G key and move it around so I could select these hit she move it around and try and get them.

07:38.250 --> 07:42.720
So they aren't overlapping on a more complex object.

07:42.720 --> 07:45.950
This would be really tedious in Blender.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.970
We have a nice couple of features here.

07:49.020 --> 07:54.750
The average Island scale tool and the pack islands.

07:54.880 --> 08:00.450
So what them do is press the key to select all the U.V. islands of the object.

08:00.970 --> 08:08.020
And then I get to come down here to Uvas and you can see in here we've got tools one is called Average

08:08.020 --> 08:10.130
Island scale or control a.

08:10.310 --> 08:13.140
And the other is pack islands control.

08:13.390 --> 08:21.670
So not only do we have to avoid overlapping but we also need to pack everything within the zero to one

08:21.670 --> 08:22.920
space.

08:22.960 --> 08:27.760
So what we can do is press control a to average Island scale.

08:27.790 --> 08:35.380
In other words it's going to make everything proportionally the same size as the objects are in the

08:35.380 --> 08:36.940
3D model.

08:37.240 --> 08:42.420
And then I want a press control P and that packs everything into the 0 2 space.

08:42.430 --> 08:48.940
Now I can also click this rotate and that will change the alignment of it.

08:48.940 --> 08:54.390
So now we've got our U-V map of our pillar and that looks pretty good.

08:54.400 --> 09:01.060
Now the one last thing we should do here is test if there is any stretching and how the texture is going

09:01.060 --> 09:04.830
to look on our object before we begin applying our texture.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.700
We really need to test that.

00:00.930 --> 00:07.260
Before I go any further I think I'd like to move this guy up off the grid here.

00:07.300 --> 00:10.180
He's sitting in the middle of the grid.

00:10.350 --> 00:15.690
And I think I'm just going to select both pieces and move them up and try and get a sense.

00:15.690 --> 00:21.870
I kind of like to have things sitting or standing on the grid here and I'm going to try and get a sense

00:21.870 --> 00:23.700
of maybe how tall this guy would be.

00:23.700 --> 00:30.140
I don't know maybe he's going to be about like this something like that.

00:30.260 --> 00:34.610
So the legs will come off here and come down to the ground.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.480
Maybe a little bit taller.

00:37.540 --> 00:44.800
And of course this can change but as I go forward I kind of like to see it in proportion with the ground

00:44.800 --> 00:46.470
plane here.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.830
All right so let's work on the arm.

00:50.200 --> 00:57.760
Now that I've moved this up my pivot point has moved or my 3D cursor is stayed where it was.

00:57.760 --> 01:07.750
And actually I'm going to need that to insert the shoulder joint onto this extruded piece here so to

01:07.750 --> 01:10.820
move that pivot point again I'm going to tab.

01:10.870 --> 01:18.520
I'm going to select the body and tab into edit mode and I think all I need to do is press control tab

01:18.520 --> 01:26.520
and choose edge mode here and alt select this ring of edges around here.

01:26.950 --> 01:31.920
And now I can just press shift s and move the cursor to selected.

01:32.380 --> 01:37.750
So now this is where I'm going to place the next object I create.

01:37.810 --> 01:44.830
So I'm going to tab back into object mode and go over to the Create tab and here I'll choose U-V sphere

01:46.550 --> 01:50.810
and the U-V sphere pops into where the 3D cursor is.

01:50.810 --> 01:59.450
So I'll hit the s key and scale down I will press the period key on the number pad to zoom in.

01:59.860 --> 02:09.110
And I think I'm going to want this to be out a little bit more so it isn't overlapping there might be

02:09.110 --> 02:10.690
something like that.

02:10.820 --> 02:17.600
And keep in mind once I get these main pieces in like the body and the arms and the legs then I'll go

02:17.600 --> 02:19.580
back and refine them.

02:19.580 --> 02:24.950
I'm just trying to get the basic shapes down first.

02:24.980 --> 02:31.730
In addition what I'm doing is I'm modeling things on one side of the character here or one side of the

02:31.730 --> 02:32.420
object.

02:32.780 --> 02:41.660
And when I've got it the way I want it I'm going to mirror what I've done on one side over to the other

02:41.660 --> 02:44.370
side using the mirror modifier.

02:44.570 --> 02:49.160
Actually before we create anything new I think I better go through and clean this up a bit just so I

02:49.160 --> 02:51.390
know what is what.

02:51.590 --> 03:00.920
So like for the body I'm going to select that and call this main body over here in the outliner and

03:00.920 --> 03:03.530
this piece I can call.

03:03.620 --> 03:09.260
What do you think we should call that cockpit glass maybe do that.

03:09.680 --> 03:15.670
And for this sphere I'll call this shoulder joint.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.190
Just for now.

03:17.390 --> 03:25.010
These are probably temporary names but as I create new pieces here it can get confusing as to what is

03:25.010 --> 03:25.830
what.

03:26.300 --> 03:31.450
So now let's create a cylinder for that upper arm.

03:31.700 --> 03:38.660
So I'll go over here to the Create tab and press cylinder and that pops into the scene at the point

03:38.660 --> 03:48.950
of 3D cursor for the number of vertices we don't really need 32 probably but 12 would probably be a

03:48.950 --> 03:57.380
good number in terms of the cap filled type we probably don't need anything on that right now so I'll

03:57.380 --> 03:59.100
just choose nothing.

04:00.090 --> 04:05.660
I will scale this down a bit and begin moving this into place.

04:05.760 --> 04:15.460
So for the top part by the shoulder joint I think what I want to do is rotate this into place.

04:15.870 --> 04:22.920
And what might make it easier for me is if the manipulators here were based instead of on the world

04:23.070 --> 04:28.020
space were based on the local space of the object itself.

04:28.020 --> 04:36.090
In other words as I rotate this you can see the rotate tool remains straight up and down remains along

04:36.090 --> 04:38.920
the world axis or global axis.

04:38.970 --> 04:47.250
I can come down here and change this from global to local and that will change the axis of movement.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.660
So it's based on the object and not the world.

04:51.660 --> 04:57.960
So if I go to the move tool you can see that it too now is aligned to the object.

04:57.960 --> 05:02.890
This can be helpful for placing objects like this.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.240
And what I'm trying to do is just place it right on that sphere.

05:07.710 --> 05:10.100
It doesn't need to be perfect right now.

05:10.100 --> 05:14.520
We'll clean it up and make a better connection here coming up.

05:14.520 --> 05:22.760
But for right now I'll go into edit mode and choose edges and I'll alter select this whole edge.

05:22.800 --> 05:33.840
I think I'll scale it in just a little bit like so so it'll fit kind of over that sphere now that I've

05:33.840 --> 05:41.070
done that I want to I want to bring this edge down a bit to where the elbows should be.

05:41.070 --> 05:47.140
And it looks like in my drawings the elbows should be about the middle of the cockpit here.

05:47.160 --> 05:53.760
So what I'll do is tab into edit mode and alt select this ring of edges and with the move tool I'll

05:53.760 --> 06:01.620
just bring it straight down like so now in my drawing it looks like it flares in a bit.

06:01.620 --> 06:04.900
So for now I think that'll work pretty well as we're blocking this in.

06:05.190 --> 06:09.910
Let's go ahead and create now an elbow joint for the arm.

06:09.930 --> 06:16.860
Once again I'm going to go into edit mode and what I'll do is alt select this edge here and now let's

06:16.860 --> 06:26.930
move the 3-D cursor to this selection by pressing shift s cursor to selected and now if I tab back into

06:27.110 --> 06:38.080
object mode I can come over here to the Create tab and click on U-V sphere and it's huge of course but

06:38.350 --> 06:47.000
we can hit the key and scale it down and fit it right in here and once again we can create a cylinder

06:47.270 --> 06:51.020
from here it will pop in to where the 3D cursor is.

06:51.020 --> 06:58.650
So I'll hit cylinder and if we look at the reference image this one really flares out a lot.

06:58.670 --> 07:05.450
So I'm going to try and get that flayer there on the forearm so I'll scale this down and begin moving

07:05.450 --> 07:06.320
it into place.

07:08.120 --> 07:15.830
Maybe I'll take this edge here at the top and scale it down with the King I'm going to select this edge

07:15.890 --> 07:24.440
and go to the scale tool and maybe flatten it up just a bit so it's wide here and a little bit thinner

07:24.830 --> 07:26.080
from the front view.

07:27.340 --> 07:34.890
One thing I would like to do is give a bit of a curve to this as it comes back toward the fingers.

07:34.960 --> 07:42.880
If I zoom in here what I'd like to do is I'd like to take this edge and flatten it in just a little

07:42.880 --> 07:49.390
bit more here and then I'm going to insert an edge loop and to insert an edge loop I'm going to press

07:49.390 --> 07:57.640
control r and it'll give me this kind of ghost image of I have an edge loop and I'll click once with

07:57.640 --> 07:58.460
the mouse.

07:58.600 --> 08:03.760
And now I can drag this up and down to where I want to place it.

08:03.760 --> 08:12.190
And I think I want to place it right about here and now and this kind of scale this out here and here.

08:12.260 --> 08:22.400
So it kind of flares out a bit and then comes in toward the where the fingers will be kind of like that.

08:22.580 --> 08:29.240
And I'll maybe even insert a new edge loop right up here and do a similar thing right here with a bit

08:29.240 --> 08:31.660
of a flayer.

08:31.880 --> 08:36.710
And before I move any further I may come back to the outliner here and clean this up some.

08:36.710 --> 08:47.830
So once again I'll double click on one of these and I'll call this forearm and call this elbow joint.

08:49.880 --> 08:54.020
And this can be our upper arm.

08:54.020 --> 08:54.290
All right.

08:54.290 --> 08:56.840
So let's work on the hands now of the hand.

08:56.840 --> 09:06.860
I think what I'd like to do is place a sphere in here and then the fingers will be actually placed into

09:06.860 --> 09:08.270
that sphere.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.060
So let's try that.

09:09.080 --> 09:18.960
I'm going to select the forearm go into Edit Mode alt select that edge and move the cursor with shift

09:18.960 --> 09:21.290
yes to the selected area.

09:21.710 --> 09:26.650
I'll tab back into object mode and let's create a sphere.

09:29.030 --> 09:33.650
And then I'll scale it down with the Eski OK.

09:33.900 --> 09:40.960
And with this I'll then select this edge and scale this in a bit as well.

09:47.650 --> 09:49.780
So let's start working on the fingers here.

09:49.780 --> 09:58.210
I think what I'm going to do is go to a brand new layer and just model these independently for now.

09:58.210 --> 10:04.760
So I click on Layer 2 and that will hide the main body away here.

10:04.960 --> 10:10.780
And then when press shift s and move the cursor to the center of the grid.

10:11.170 --> 10:17.710
And now I think I'm just going to begin with a cube so I'll click on the cube in the create tab and

10:17.710 --> 10:19.840
that will pop in.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.270
I think I'll just move it up a bit.

10:24.090 --> 10:32.730
From here I think I'll create a cylinder to be the joint between the fingers.

10:32.730 --> 10:36.440
So let's go with cylinder.

10:36.720 --> 10:43.980
You can see here in the ADD cylinder options panel here that we've got 32 vertices we don't need that

10:43.980 --> 10:44.280
many.

10:44.280 --> 10:52.770
I'm just going to have about 12 and instead of the fill type being gone what I'd like to do is change

10:52.800 --> 10:55.850
this to triangle fan.

10:56.110 --> 11:03.670
I want to rotate this around the x axis and rotate it this way and I want it exactly 90 degrees so I'll

11:03.670 --> 11:12.220
press the end key to bring up the properties panel here and type 90 degrees and then scale this a bit

11:12.250 --> 11:16.550
and I'm going to place this as a joint right by the finger here.

11:16.810 --> 11:21.330
So I'll move this and move this over to the finger.

11:21.340 --> 11:27.880
Now I want to see that this is right in line with this so what I'm going to do is first of all I'm going

11:27.880 --> 11:34.360
to frame that cylinder up with the period key on the numpad and the next thing I want to do is press

11:34.360 --> 11:42.210
the one key to go to the front view and then I'm going to press the five key to go to orthographic view.

11:42.700 --> 11:47.550
So now I can see these objects in an orthographic view without any perspective.

11:48.480 --> 12:00.870
So I'm going to scale this down just a bit something like this and place this right about here so that

12:00.860 --> 12:05.570
this digit of the finger will rotate right around here.

12:05.570 --> 12:07.770
Ultimately at that joint.

12:08.330 --> 12:14.960
So I'm in a tumble around and then hit the 5 key to go back to perspective view and then I'm going to

12:14.960 --> 12:20.050
go to the seven key and five key and look at it from the top.

12:20.150 --> 12:26.690
And here I think I'll move this a bit like that and now I'm going to duplicate this object actually

12:26.690 --> 12:34.080
before I do that I think I want to scale this would make it a little thicker like this.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.000
There we go.

12:35.300 --> 12:40.420
And to duplicate this object I'm just going to shift the and then click.

12:40.810 --> 12:45.090
And now I can move the new object away from the old object there.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.780
So maybe something like that.

12:47.800 --> 12:54.450
So now I've got this piece with a joint in the middle there.

12:54.780 --> 12:55.820
And one more thing.

12:55.820 --> 13:01.800
One more thing actually let's create another cylinder and put in a cylinder right through the center

13:01.800 --> 13:03.420
of these objects here.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.400
So going to create a cylinder

13:08.040 --> 13:17.570
rotated again around the x axis scale this down make it a little longer now as well.

13:18.350 --> 13:22.410
And now here's another trick of the 3D cursor.

13:22.440 --> 13:29.620
I'm going to select these two objects press shift s and bring that cursor to the selected objects.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.280
So that puts it right in the center of those two objects.

13:33.350 --> 13:41.600
Now going to grab this cylinder press shift s and select selection to cursor and that pops it right

13:41.600 --> 13:43.590
into the center of those two objects.

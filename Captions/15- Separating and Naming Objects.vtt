00:00.630 --> 00:06.340
Now that we have the arms and the hands in the general size we want them to be let's do a little bit

00:06.340 --> 00:10.440
of house cleaning and split them out and give them each a name.

00:10.450 --> 00:14.740
So if we select this we can see that we've got the mirror are still on it.

00:14.740 --> 00:22.700
Let's take away that mirror modifier for the time being just so we can go in and separate these pieces.

00:22.750 --> 00:29.440
I think what we need to do is separate the pieces for the upper arm and then the lower arm and then

00:29.440 --> 00:35.130
the hand and we'll also split the fingers out into individual objects as well.

00:35.410 --> 00:40.780
So for the upper arm let's tab into edit mode and then let's go ahead and select this upper arm with

00:40.780 --> 00:47.520
the L key hover over an edge and press l and then I'll do the same thing up here for the sphere.

00:47.830 --> 00:53.640
We'll just press l there and that will select just that part of the object.

00:53.650 --> 00:58.240
Let's now press the P key and separated out by selection.

00:58.540 --> 01:01.580
And now that is its own object.

01:01.730 --> 01:03.950
It's tab back into object mode.

01:04.180 --> 01:05.290
De-select everything.

01:05.290 --> 01:16.400
Now if we select this new object we can call this upper arm underscore l the naming convention may change.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.450
But let's give that a try.

01:18.660 --> 01:23.920
Then I'll select the original object again and tab into edit mode.

01:24.120 --> 01:30.520
And this time I'll hover over the lower arm and then also the elbow.

01:30.900 --> 01:38.950
And then I'll press the P key and separate by selection tab back into object mode select that new object

01:39.700 --> 01:42.130
and let's call this lower arm.

01:42.130 --> 01:43.630
Underscore L.

01:43.980 --> 01:50.040
Now for the hands this portion here will need to be its own object so let's tab into edit mode.

01:50.130 --> 01:52.520
Hover over this press the L key.

01:52.680 --> 01:56.790
And now let's press P and separate that out.

01:57.030 --> 02:04.470
We can call this I'll select it and we can call this hand underscore.

02:05.070 --> 02:10.050
Now for these pieces the fingers pose an interesting challenge.

02:10.230 --> 02:17.790
We need to separate these out individually and we need to do it in such a way that we'll be able to

02:18.090 --> 02:21.660
rig the fingers and animate them in the future.

02:21.660 --> 02:29.700
So if we tap into Edit Mode what we can do is select say this piece this piece this piece and this piece

02:29.700 --> 02:33.970
with the L key and that will be one object.

02:34.020 --> 02:42.270
So I'll hit P and separate that object out tab back into object mode and select that and let's call

02:42.270 --> 02:43.720
this.

02:44.430 --> 02:50.820
We're going to call this thumb three because we're going to say that this is the first joint second

02:50.820 --> 02:52.020
joint third joint.

02:52.010 --> 02:57.670
So let's call this from three underscore Al.

02:57.670 --> 03:00.470
There we go select the next one.

03:00.470 --> 03:01.950
Select that object.

03:02.330 --> 03:03.860
Hover over this.

03:03.860 --> 03:07.640
Select these three with the L key like that.

03:07.660 --> 03:15.600
Press the P key split that out tab back into object mode and let's give this a name to.

03:15.800 --> 03:21.500
This will be Thum to underscore L and then this piece right here.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.530
We'll hit the L key for that.

03:26.530 --> 03:27.890
Separate it out.

03:27.900 --> 03:33.260
Select it individually and we'll call this thumb one underscore.

03:33.320 --> 03:36.610
Well here we go.

03:36.610 --> 03:43.910
Now we can go through and begin doing that for the rest of the fingers so I'll hover here here here

03:43.970 --> 03:52.730
and here pressing the L key and begin again with the index finger middle and Pinky.

03:52.730 --> 03:59.430
So I'll work on that before the next video where we will work on adding more loops and smoothing our

03:59.520 --> 04:00.020
objects.

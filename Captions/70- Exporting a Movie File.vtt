00:00.690 --> 00:08.430
Now that our frames are rendered out let's look at how we can export those out to a single quick time

00:08.520 --> 00:15.600
movie to do that we need to go over here to the video editing screen layout.

00:15.960 --> 00:23.190
And when we do that we get this screen here this window down here is our video sequence editor and this

00:23.190 --> 00:32.580
will allow us to drop our image sequence on the timeline as if it's a single movie clip and then we'll

00:32.580 --> 00:35.440
be able to export it out to quick time.

00:35.790 --> 00:42.820
So what I should do is come down here to add and choose image because we're choosing an image sequence.

00:44.900 --> 00:50.650
I'm going to browse to my project folder and go to that rendered frames folder.

00:50.750 --> 00:59.150
And here are all the rendered frames from zero all the way to 310.

00:59.240 --> 01:07.880
So I'll just press the A key to select them all and choose add image Strip and there is our movie.

01:07.880 --> 01:12.110
Now I'm going to zoom in just a little bit here so we can see this.

01:12.110 --> 01:23.800
So if I hit play there's our movie now it's running a little slow right now but it'll cache and play

01:24.010 --> 01:27.660
quicker the next time we play it.

01:27.760 --> 01:37.770
I'm going to zoom in a bit by dragging this bar over here just a bit so I can see the whole thing.

01:37.790 --> 01:39.550
So this is our clip.

01:39.560 --> 01:45.230
This is our rendered movie and we could export this out the way it is.

01:45.260 --> 01:53.600
But what I've done is I've added a little bit of fade to white as the spotlight comes around right about

01:53.600 --> 01:55.900
here I've faded to white.

01:56.210 --> 02:04.700
So let's do that maybe right around in here is when the fade would begin sort of do that.

02:04.700 --> 02:11.330
I'm going to come over here to add effects strip and I'll choose a color

02:14.000 --> 02:16.840
and that pops in right at where the cursor is.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.790
But I want to change this from black to white.

02:19.940 --> 02:25.630
So if I scroll down here I can change this.

02:25.790 --> 02:34.100
And we go now what I'd like to do is to crossfade from the clip to the white.

02:34.100 --> 02:41.150
So when I select the clip and shift select the white color strip and then I'm going to come back to

02:41.210 --> 02:45.760
add effect and cross.

02:46.100 --> 02:49.500
And that adds a crossfade there at that point.

02:50.470 --> 03:00.360
So now it's going to fade into white one thing I should also do is kind of increase the frame length

03:00.480 --> 03:02.740
of my movie here.

03:03.090 --> 03:09.390
And so I'll expand this out and I want to extend this out to three sixty.

03:09.540 --> 03:14.330
So I'm just going to select this little end of the strip and you can see it says 320.

03:14.340 --> 03:22.840
There are press g and then drag and move this out to 360.

03:23.110 --> 03:23.770
And there we go.

03:23.770 --> 03:30.920
So now if I go back to the beginning and press play now we're playing at 24 frames per second

03:40.470 --> 03:43.230
and we can see a crossfade.

03:43.260 --> 03:47.640
All right so now let's go ahead and export it out to a movie file.

03:47.700 --> 03:54.900
I'm going to click on this little tab here and drag it so I can open up a new window because what I

03:54.900 --> 03:59.330
want is that properties panel that the render settings are on.

03:59.640 --> 04:08.970
So I come up here to properties and in this window we need to scroll down so into the output section

04:08.970 --> 04:15.060
I'm going to click on the browse button here eyebrows to the main portion of my project folder and here's

04:15.060 --> 04:24.890
where I'll drop my rendered movie so I'll just call this final render and I'll click accept.

04:24.910 --> 04:29.670
Now I want to make sure that my start and in frame are correct.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.710
So I've got it from 1 to 360.

04:33.980 --> 04:45.660
If I scroll down here I need to change my output type from PMG to quick time and I need to change the

04:45.690 --> 04:56.890
video codec from j peg to h to 6 for and I'm going to go ahead and increase the quality up to 100 percent.

04:56.910 --> 05:01.680
Now if I scroll back up and click on animation

05:06.340 --> 05:08.200
it'll render out my final movie.

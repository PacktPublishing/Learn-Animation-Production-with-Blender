00:01.110 --> 00:05.670
I think this kaufen here would be a good candidate for the sculped tools.

00:05.710 --> 00:14.290
So let's go ahead and select that and I'm going to isolate it with the division key and let's work on

00:14.290 --> 00:15.770
this.

00:15.850 --> 00:19.930
I'll add the multi resolution modifier here.

00:21.050 --> 00:26.270
And as I increase the subdivisions I'll click on subdivide.

00:26.270 --> 00:29.760
Here you can see that it kind of collapses.

00:29.780 --> 00:33.150
And that's really not going to work for us.

00:33.470 --> 00:40.960
What we need is a way to increase the subdivisions without it collapsing into a blob.

00:41.570 --> 00:47.460
So what we can do is change from the Catmull Clark subdivision to simple.

00:47.510 --> 00:55.520
And if we click on that now we have increased resolution on the objects without them turning into little

00:55.520 --> 00:56.960
blobs.

00:56.960 --> 01:04.490
So if I hit the Z key to take a look at it in wireframe you can see that it's got a higher resolution

01:04.490 --> 01:09.470
than say if we hit the tab key and look at it in edit mode.

01:09.470 --> 01:14.500
So we're still getting increased resolution just without the smoothing.

01:14.510 --> 01:18.090
Let me go ahead and increase it a couple more times maybe.

01:18.290 --> 01:26.940
Let's go up to 4 here and now switch from object mode to sculpt mode and one of the things I'd like

01:26.940 --> 01:31.080
to do is just to beat it up a little bit.

01:31.080 --> 01:39.600
I'd like these corners and the edges to be not quite as uniform like it's aged and decayed over time.

01:39.750 --> 01:49.100
So I'm just going to grab the grab tool and with shift f maybe bring the strength down a bit like that

01:50.090 --> 01:57.200
and if I come in here I can just begin pulling around and beating up these corners just a bit.

01:57.200 --> 02:04.670
I don't want a whole lot just a little bit enough to make it feel like it's old and decayed so I'll

02:04.670 --> 02:11.930
hit the F key and increase the brush size a bit and just come in here and begin moving these around

02:12.230 --> 02:13.370
just a little bit.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.310
OK I think that's helped some.

02:17.310 --> 02:26.010
In addition let's go back to the sculped draw tool and I'd like to also beat up the corners a bit with

02:26.010 --> 02:32.040
this as well so I'm going to press F and reduce the size of my brush.

02:33.000 --> 02:40.130
And I'm just zoom in and if I test a stroke here you can see that that's what I get.

02:40.350 --> 02:45.290
I think I'll increase the subdivisions one more time here and see what I get.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.000
Yeah that's a little smoother.

02:47.280 --> 02:56.520
So with the sculped DRob rush I'll just begin kind of both drawing and cutting in so I'll do a stroke.

02:56.520 --> 03:01.700
I'll hold the control key down and I'll also cut into this a bit.

03:02.040 --> 03:07.090
And in addition I think maybe I'll try and add a texture brush to this as well.

03:07.080 --> 03:16.360
So over here in this sculped panel scroll down and add another texture here click new and over here

03:16.360 --> 03:28.950
in the texture panel I can see my texture here and I'll choose maybe a noise and under stroke over here

03:28.950 --> 03:34.220
in the sculped panel and go over here to stroke and I'll try anchored.

03:34.290 --> 03:41.970
I'm going to choose this and what that should do is when I click and drag it will increase or decrease

03:41.970 --> 03:49.140
the size of my of my brush and I can throw down that texture then onto the object.

03:49.140 --> 03:51.090
Now that's a little too much.

03:51.090 --> 03:54.080
I'm going to come back up here to the strength.

03:54.100 --> 04:01.080
Yeah I'm going to press shift F and reduce the strength quite a bit there.

04:01.110 --> 04:09.180
Now I'm going to click and drag and add some texture like this with the anchored brush here.

04:10.260 --> 04:15.500
All right well let's go take a look at the stairs now and let's do kind of the same thing.

04:15.960 --> 04:25.380
So I'm going to go ahead and remove this texture for now and I'll hit the division key on the numpad

04:25.380 --> 04:33.660
to come back to our scene and I'll select the stairs over here isolate them and let's go through and

04:33.660 --> 04:35.660
do the same thing here.

04:35.940 --> 04:45.540
I'm going to add a multi resolution modifier and I'll subdivided up two four or five.

04:45.600 --> 04:54.380
And as we did before let's choose simple instead of Catmull Clark I'll go to the sculped tool and I'll

04:54.390 --> 04:57.020
choose the grab tool here.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.750
I'll reduce the size of my brush a bit.

05:00.960 --> 05:06.190
And let's come in here and try and beat this up a bit like we did before.

05:06.190 --> 05:13.260
So I'll just grab these and try and give it some give it some wear and tear

05:16.260 --> 05:23.380
and then let's go and use the sculpt tool to add some more detail to it.

05:24.490 --> 05:33.760
I think increase the subdivisions one more time and I should go down and change back from anchored to

05:33.760 --> 05:41.800
something like dots and I'll just come through and begin beating this up as well.

05:43.580 --> 05:50.570
Pressing the control key to cut in as well as just laying down sculp strokes.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.140
There we go so it's pretty beat up.

05:53.140 --> 06:02.670
Now we could also maybe go over to object mode here and click on smooth shading and that couldn't help

06:03.000 --> 06:07.120
smooth that out and blend it together some.

06:07.230 --> 06:13.950
All right well I'll hit the division key to go back to our scene and in the next video we'll take a

06:13.950 --> 06:17.060
look at doing a little sculpting on the ceiling.

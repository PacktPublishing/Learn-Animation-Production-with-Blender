00:01.080 --> 00:10.770
Let's take a look at the fingers of fingers we want we want to control for the main joint here because

00:10.860 --> 00:15.750
that's the main access or that's the main thing we want to control all the others.

00:15.750 --> 00:22.860
I don't think I really care about having individual access to the other joints here.

00:22.860 --> 00:28.380
So all we really need is this main base Joint for each of the fingers.

00:28.430 --> 00:39.470
I'll go ahead and create a circle I'll call it shape fingers and let's come in here and select one of

00:39.470 --> 00:40.170
these fingers.

00:40.170 --> 00:45.660
Now so this is finger thumb one.

00:45.680 --> 00:52.510
I'll select the custom shape and find that shape fingers and click wireframe.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.230
And so there we are.

00:53.230 --> 00:53.830
There it is.

00:53.830 --> 01:03.520
It's OK it's a little it's not oriented the way I would want so I'm going to select that and turn on

01:03.520 --> 01:06.090
my manipulators.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.560
Now let's see if I rotated in the x.

01:08.560 --> 01:09.910
What will it do.

01:09.940 --> 01:16.800
OK so now what if I swing it around in the Z.

01:17.090 --> 01:18.820
That's not too bad.

01:20.260 --> 01:21.840
Let me line up a little better.

01:21.850 --> 01:28.450
I'm going to go into the front view and 5 and line this up so it's on axis here.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.030
Let me scale it down a bit and now I'm going to move it.

01:34.300 --> 01:40.580
See how this works I'm going to move it this way and this way.

01:40.630 --> 01:50.070
So it's kind of just hovering out over the finger like so and like so.

01:50.070 --> 01:56.550
All right so because if I select that then I should be able just to hit R and rotate it.

01:56.660 --> 01:59.840
Yeah that works.

01:59.930 --> 02:07.910
All right let's do that for the others I'll select this shape fingers narrative.

02:07.940 --> 02:14.580
So each one is going to be a little bit bigger since each bone is a little bit different sized but that's

02:14.580 --> 02:15.250
fine.

02:17.550 --> 02:20.730
And I'll go through and do these other fingers as well.

02:22.150 --> 02:26.640
All right well we're almost there we've got most of them done.

02:26.770 --> 02:27.970
The last one.

02:27.970 --> 02:32.020
It looks like is this bone for the spotlight.

02:32.290 --> 02:35.530
What I'd like to do for this is select this bone.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.140
And I better go to Edit mode here.

02:38.410 --> 02:44.120
I'll select that bone and I actually select this joint and snap the cursor to it.

02:45.820 --> 02:55.300
And then in edit mode I will press shift a to create a new bone and I'll select two that and what I

02:55.300 --> 03:03.590
want to do is move this straight out from that bone now I'm going to go to the side view and make sure

03:03.590 --> 03:08.390
that it's about the same distance away as the KNEEBONE here.

03:08.420 --> 03:14.990
It doesn't need to be I'm just trying to be neat and organized and let's call this bone

03:18.460 --> 03:21.600
light track.

03:21.670 --> 03:28.930
Now we should create a constraint for this spotlight bone so that wherever we move this bone it tracks

03:29.440 --> 03:32.170
or points to it at all times.

03:32.180 --> 03:42.040
So let me come back in here to pose mode and I'll select this bone and in our constraints panel over

03:42.040 --> 03:54.420
here let's add a bone constraint track to and of course we want to have the target be the armature have

03:54.420 --> 04:03.970
the bone B that light track and now we see that as soon as we do that let's test it here.

04:06.530 --> 04:07.630
I move this around.

04:07.630 --> 04:08.940
The light points at it.

04:08.950 --> 04:09.790
That's true.

04:09.790 --> 04:16.150
But look at the way it's oriented it flips it around completely.

04:16.210 --> 04:22.210
If we look at the constraint we can see that it says that the z is up and we can change this but I don't

04:22.210 --> 04:26.690
think that's going to help us much.

04:26.710 --> 04:31.620
Now we've got y up but it doesn't work at all.

04:31.780 --> 04:34.180
So that's not going to help.

04:34.330 --> 04:43.270
We really want it to be with z up and the y facing forward or tracking along the y and that's what it's

04:43.270 --> 04:49.690
doing but it's just flipping this over so let's see what we can do about this.

04:49.690 --> 04:57.150
I'm going to select this and remove the constraint and that'll flip it back up and go into edit mode.

04:57.160 --> 05:02.080
And with this bone selected let's turn on the axes.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.360
I'll go back to the armature panel.

05:04.420 --> 05:07.490
Turn on axes and let's see if we can see.

05:07.870 --> 05:13.970
Well if you look at this it says that the z is pointing down and the Y is pointing forward.

05:13.970 --> 05:21.850
So in other words when we applied that constraint it automatically flipped it down so that the Z was

05:21.850 --> 05:22.300
up.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.880
But it was actually facing down.

05:24.910 --> 05:27.370
So let's use the roll here.

05:27.390 --> 05:31.960
I'll click and drag in here and we can just type in 180

05:34.600 --> 05:41.950
and that will rearrange that so that Z is facing up and the Y is facing forward.

05:42.040 --> 05:46.540
Let's give that a try I'll go back to pose mode now.

05:46.780 --> 05:50.570
And the problem is is that it's flips it over.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.740
Now when we go into polars mode.

05:53.140 --> 05:56.260
So let's undo this.

05:56.340 --> 05:57.690
So that's not going to work.

05:57.690 --> 06:04.830
What we need to do before what we need to do before we rotate this is unpleasant.

06:04.950 --> 06:12.010
The light so let's select that light here that's its own object.

06:12.110 --> 06:16.860
Remember I'm going to press alt P and I'm going to clear the parent.

06:16.890 --> 06:23.040
Now let's go back into edit mode and roll that back up.

06:23.040 --> 06:27.330
So the Z's facing up.

06:27.670 --> 06:37.180
Now if I tab back into PPOs mode I can select the light shift select that bone and press control P and

06:37.180 --> 06:40.080
parent to the bone.

06:40.080 --> 06:48.530
Now we should be able to go ahead and turn off axes here and go back to our bone constraint panel.

06:48.530 --> 06:54.860
I'm going to de-select everything here when you get out of here back to object mode so I can de-select

06:55.520 --> 07:03.880
everything so the light isn't selected like the bone go back to pose mode.

07:03.940 --> 07:13.150
And now let's add a constraint a track to with the Z being up and tracking for the Y.

07:13.310 --> 07:20.440
Let's choose the armature and that light track bone.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.810
Now when we choose that bone and hit G.

07:23.990 --> 07:27.140
Now the light tracks wherever that bone is.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.110
That's good.

07:29.120 --> 07:37.920
All right so now let's create a custom shape for this bone all go back to object mode.

07:39.650 --> 07:42.910
De-select everything I'll get the cursor back to the center

07:45.450 --> 07:52.460
and for this I'll create two circles or create one circle here.

07:53.360 --> 08:01.690
And scale it in and then I'll create one more and maybe scale that in a bit as well.

08:01.690 --> 08:10.960
So I get this kind of target shape so like these two and press control J to combine them into one object

08:11.620 --> 08:15.800
and I'll call this shape light.

08:15.820 --> 08:23.150
Now we want to choose this in pose mode and here it is.

08:23.550 --> 08:33.360
And we want to go to the bone panel choose Custom shape type and shape and choose the shape light and

08:33.360 --> 08:35.170
choose wireframe.

08:35.700 --> 08:36.300
And there we go.

08:36.300 --> 08:37.490
So it's a little big.

08:37.490 --> 08:48.430
We can go select this go into edit mode and scale it down a bit so that we can have our custom shape

08:48.430 --> 08:49.120
for the light.

08:49.120 --> 08:54.160
So now if I come into pose mode let me choose.

08:54.610 --> 08:56.130
Get out of it mode.

08:56.380 --> 08:57.420
Choose that one.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.810
And there we go.

08:58.810 --> 09:04.240
Now I should be able to move that around and you can see the light comes along with it.

09:05.630 --> 09:08.990
Well that pretty much finishes the rig for the Mac.

09:09.110 --> 09:14.300
But the last thing we need to do is hide the bones a way that we aren't going to be using that we don't

09:14.300 --> 09:21.050
need to see and to do that we need to come over here to the armature panel and here in the layers we

09:21.050 --> 09:28.250
need to move them into a layer say Layer 2 that we won't be using.

09:28.340 --> 09:39.750
So I'm going to come in here and select all of these bones just shift select them and with those selected

09:39.750 --> 09:44.580
I can just press them and move these over to layer 2.

09:44.780 --> 09:46.030
And there they go.

09:46.580 --> 09:48.380
So you can see them over here.

09:48.380 --> 09:53.250
There they are but they're hidden away so we don't have to deal with them.

09:53.300 --> 09:59.380
I missed these AM and layer too.

09:59.910 --> 10:02.240
Let's get the arms and the fingers here.

10:05.920 --> 10:09.740
I'll press them and select one or two again.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.520
Those away let's get the spotlight

10:14.210 --> 10:17.430
and let's move this arm over to layer two as well.

10:18.380 --> 10:18.880
All right.

10:18.890 --> 10:26.990
So there is the rig so we should be able to select this and move it down and around like this in the

10:26.990 --> 10:32.230
arms and move them around and the legs and move those around.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.010
And that's great.

10:33.020 --> 10:36.920
But the problem is now we have one more thing we need to do.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.960
The problem is is he's going to be moving through the scene.

10:41.060 --> 10:45.870
But if I try and select this and move him.

10:45.910 --> 10:46.980
Look at what happens.

10:47.020 --> 10:50.910
It leaves a lot of the rig behind.

10:51.060 --> 10:54.440
So all right click to get him back there.

10:54.850 --> 11:03.520
So what we need to do is create a master control that allows us to just select one item and move the

11:03.520 --> 11:06.610
entire rig and character around the scene.

WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:08.190
Well we are now ready to move into the texturing phase now that we've got basic light set up here you

00:08.190 --> 00:16.950
may notice that when rendering this out with the rendered viewport shading that you get a lot of these

00:16.950 --> 00:23.870
little fireflies in the render they're little white dots all over the place.

00:23.910 --> 00:29.780
Those I think maybe caused by kind of excessive reflectivity here on the Mac.

00:29.790 --> 00:35.760
And we can come in and turn down the reflectivity but that's not always going to do the trick.

00:35.760 --> 00:46.510
So I'm going to come over here to the render panel and if I scroll down underneath the light paths section

00:46.930 --> 00:56.440
is a couple of settings for cost caustic and caustic are the light patterns that are created when light

00:56.500 --> 01:01.600
goes through a refractive material like glass or something like that.

01:01.720 --> 01:10.670
And they can also be caused by reflections as well but I'm not going to turn these off and let blender

01:10.670 --> 01:17.930
really render this and you'll see hopefully that those little fireflies are pretty much gone and we

01:17.930 --> 01:20.690
don't really need Kostic in this scene.

01:20.750 --> 01:27.770
We only use those if we were doing maybe a close up of a glass of tea with ice cubes or something like

01:27.770 --> 01:30.230
that for a scene like this.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.160
We don't really need them at all.

01:32.360 --> 01:37.600
So just clicking those couple of things can really clean up your scene.

01:37.610 --> 01:38.080
All right.

01:38.090 --> 01:41.120
So let's move on to texturing.

01:41.120 --> 01:49.310
What I'm going to be doing is using an image manipulation program called Gimp and it too is free to

01:49.310 --> 01:52.020
download free to use in any way.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.340
So it's a really great companion to Blender.

01:55.400 --> 02:02.570
It's been around a while and it's really been developed over time to be a good solid program.

02:02.570 --> 02:08.100
Now there are two main ways that I'm going to be applying textures to our object in the scene.

02:08.180 --> 02:16.760
One going to apply the texture directly in blender and then adjust how many times the texture repeats

02:16.820 --> 02:24.470
over the object and the other is that I'm going to export the U-V maps of objects out to Gimp and then

02:24.470 --> 02:30.910
paint over or lay images over those U-V maps them.

02:30.920 --> 02:38.960
Once I've done that I'm going to bring that image texture that color map back into blender and apply

02:38.960 --> 02:40.280
it there.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.750
So anyway let's take a look at this.

02:43.760 --> 02:51.630
So first of all I think what I'm going to do is work on this kaufen all zoom into it here.

02:51.820 --> 02:53.180
And let's take a look at this.

02:53.180 --> 02:57.680
Now if you recall this is a U-V map.

02:57.680 --> 03:02.340
This just a lot of different pieces a lot of different islands broken up.

03:02.660 --> 03:06.760
Let's take a look at it in the U-V texture editor here.

03:06.800 --> 03:11.180
So if I hit the tab key Heres the movie map.

03:11.180 --> 03:18.610
So it is just a big explosion of polygons or U-V islands.

03:18.770 --> 03:27.110
So what lets do instead is actually bring a texture into here so let's go from here to Gamp.

03:27.110 --> 03:27.950
So this is Gamp.

03:27.940 --> 03:31.970
It's an image manipulation program a paint program.

03:32.180 --> 03:39.400
It's really useful as I said as a companion to Blendr when doing things like texturing.

03:39.680 --> 03:45.410
If yours looks a little different than mine does here is probably because the first thing I did when

03:45.410 --> 03:50.940
I opened it was I went to Windows and I chose single window mode.

03:50.990 --> 03:57.080
Otherwise Gamp opens up in a lot of modular windows that you have to kind of move around.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.060
I like it on one screen.

03:59.330 --> 04:06.710
So for the texture of that coffin let me show you what I've found so far and I got a file open and I've

04:06.710 --> 04:15.890
got a folder called Images here in my project folder and in here I've stored a couple of things I've

04:15.890 --> 04:17.360
found on the Internet.

04:17.630 --> 04:27.990
So this sandstone If I open that I'm going to press the minus key on the keyboard to kind of zoom out.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.880
So here is that texture.

04:30.050 --> 04:37.350
Now one of the things I'm going to want to do is repeat this texture several times over the U-V map.

04:37.800 --> 04:46.650
And if I repeated it the way it is now I would get visible seams between the tiles of the texture.

04:46.670 --> 04:53.420
So what I need to do is make this seamless or as seamless as possible so that when it repeats we don't

04:53.420 --> 04:56.780
see the seams between the tiles.

04:56.990 --> 05:04.510
And then one of many things I like about Gimp is that it has a feature to make this seamless.

05:04.610 --> 05:06.060
Built right in.

05:06.140 --> 05:17.500
So I can come up here to filter's map and make seamless and if I click that and then it will think for

05:17.500 --> 05:25.770
a while and it will actually go through and re calculate the image to make the edges seamless.

05:26.110 --> 05:27.360
And there we go.

05:27.910 --> 05:33.070
So now I can save this or export this out as a seamless texture.

05:33.130 --> 05:36.990
So I'll go a file export as.

05:37.230 --> 05:39.620
And in this one I'm going to call.

05:39.720 --> 05:52.640
I'm going to put this in my textures folder and I will call this sandstone seamless and click export.

05:52.660 --> 05:58.000
So now that I've done that let's go back to Blendr and apply the texture.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.880
All right now that we're back in Blender Let's go ahead and apply that texture.

06:02.920 --> 06:07.300
Notice this has a material on it called blocks and stairs.

06:07.300 --> 06:14.280
And if you recall I set up this material for both the coffin and the stairs in the scene.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.750
So keep that in mind as we move forward here.

06:16.750 --> 06:23.260
I want to just show you what happens when this when we have a material assigned to two different objects.

06:23.260 --> 06:30.250
All right so the first thing I'm going to do is I want to bring in a texture coordinate node to do that

06:30.250 --> 06:37.690
I'm going to come over here to add good input and going to choose texture coordinate and that gives

06:37.690 --> 06:38.760
us this node.

06:38.770 --> 06:42.260
Here let me make this just a little bigger here.

06:43.950 --> 06:49.140
And then we want to also bring in our texture so I can go to add again.

06:49.140 --> 06:52.150
But as you see here the shortcut is shift a.

06:52.210 --> 07:00.940
So I'll press shift a and I'm going to go to texture and image texture.

07:01.200 --> 07:09.460
Now I've got this image texture that I'm going to want to apply based on the UVA's of my object.

07:09.480 --> 07:16.890
The U-V map down here I'm going to want to bring the color of the texture in and apply the color to

07:17.310 --> 07:23.750
the object and I'll open this and go find that texture.

07:23.750 --> 07:33.960
So in my textures folder here I'll choose that sandstones seamless and open that.

07:34.130 --> 07:43.290
Now you can see over here click tab that that texture has been applied to my object.

07:43.670 --> 07:45.620
But I think it looks a little bit too big.

07:45.620 --> 07:50.400
I'd like the texture to be a little smaller on the object.

07:50.430 --> 07:55.460
So what we can do is repeat the texture multiple times.

07:55.770 --> 07:58.920
So I'm going to go back to my default view here.

07:59.640 --> 08:04.700
And I'll go to texture viewport shading.

08:05.260 --> 08:07.770
Let's go over to our materials.

08:08.110 --> 08:15.460
We can see that the material is this blocks and stairs and we have an image texture coming into our

08:15.460 --> 08:16.500
material.

08:16.900 --> 08:24.250
But if I go over to the texture panel over here I can see under the image texture selection.

08:24.250 --> 08:30.820
Now if I click this you can see you've got brush brush mask an image texture.

08:30.910 --> 08:35.900
If yours happens to be on brush go ahead and switch it over to Image texture.

08:37.370 --> 08:40.100
And right down here we've got mapping.

08:40.400 --> 08:48.260
And if we increase the scale of the mapping we can increase the number of times that it repeats over

08:48.260 --> 08:49.220
the texture.

08:49.580 --> 08:57.170
So if I click and drag over these three fields and maybe type in three and hit enter you can see that

08:57.170 --> 09:02.460
it gets smaller the texture gets smaller on the object.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.070
Well let's try to

09:08.210 --> 09:10.040
yeah maybe something like that.

09:11.220 --> 09:18.990
Now you can also increase the scale of one access or another so let's say I wanted to increase the scale

09:19.050 --> 09:24.380
in the X I can maybe take this and type in five and it would stretch it.

09:24.570 --> 09:29.900
Or maybe I wanted to decrease the scale I could type in one and it would do that.

09:29.900 --> 09:35.950
So you can scale it in a non-uniform way depending on how much you want to do.

09:35.990 --> 09:38.500
So I'll go back to there.

09:38.510 --> 09:38.830
All right.

09:38.830 --> 09:43.800
So that is really our texture for the coffin.

09:43.880 --> 09:48.030
Let's go take a look at the stairs and see what happened to it as well.

09:50.030 --> 09:59.670
You can see over here that our stairs now have that same texture on it.

09:59.690 --> 10:06.450
That's because remember we had the same material on those two objects.

10:06.560 --> 10:13.640
And I don't know if you recall I said that textures are assigned to materials and materials are applied

10:13.640 --> 10:14.890
to objects.

10:14.990 --> 10:22.130
So if two objects have the same material then whatever texture we apply to that material will also be

10:22.130 --> 10:25.010
applied to those multiple objects.

10:25.010 --> 10:32.390
So I actually want to be able to adjust the scale for this independently of the other object.

10:32.420 --> 10:39.320
So what I'm going to do with this object selected I'm going to add a new material slot click new to

10:39.320 --> 10:41.150
add a new material to it.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.260
And for this I'll call this stairs.

10:44.720 --> 10:52.790
Now this one here I'll go ahead and rename because it needs to be just called blocks or maybe I could

10:52.790 --> 10:54.820
call it coffin.

10:54.860 --> 10:56.730
Why don't I do that.

10:56.930 --> 10:59.510
And now I'm going to remove it from this object.

10:59.510 --> 11:01.920
Now it's still going to be on that other object.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.990
But I'm going to remove it from here.

11:05.130 --> 11:13.980
Now with the stairs material I'll go back to the U-V editing and lay out isolate this one just so we

11:13.980 --> 11:25.590
can see it once again I'll press shift a bring in a texture coordinate node press shift a bring in an

11:25.650 --> 11:30.350
image texture and I'll hook these up.

11:30.630 --> 11:41.340
So the Uvas into the image texture the color into the diffuse Chaytor and I'll pull down this little

11:41.550 --> 11:45.040
menu and choose sandstones seamless.

11:45.420 --> 11:47.520
And there we go.

11:47.520 --> 11:58.330
Now I have independent control of it using this texture panel image texture mapping.

11:58.350 --> 12:05.540
Now I can adjust this independently of the other objects so I'm going to take this up to four maybe

12:05.550 --> 12:12.320
so it's a little bit smaller on the object maybe even five here.

12:14.500 --> 12:19.580
And in addition I can see some repeats happening here kind of at an angle.

12:19.890 --> 12:30.100
What I can do is I can adjust this say rotate it in the z and it will rotate that texture.

12:30.550 --> 12:34.750
And I'm going to try and rotate it so it isn't quite as obvious.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.960
Something like that.

12:37.150 --> 12:45.150
So those lines of the textures go along the stairway instead of cutting through them at an angle.

12:45.460 --> 12:51.840
And so now the repeats aren't quite as visible because they're part of the structure of the object.

12:52.330 --> 12:59.370
So you have quite a bit of control here and the mapping for both scale and rotation.

00:00.780 --> 00:06.660
Now I think we can begin working on the end of the animation where you just kind of looks around the

00:06.660 --> 00:15.450
room and this is the point where I'd like to begin animating with this control so that maybe he looks

00:16.500 --> 00:22.410
he looks down looks over and then I'd like it to look back right at the camera.

00:22.410 --> 00:24.320
I'm going to try that.

00:24.590 --> 00:30.480
So let's actually let's take a look at the animation real quick before we move on.

00:30.920 --> 00:37.280
We've got him now so he kind of drops down and floats and then moves forward a bit and then turns off

00:37.280 --> 00:39.440
his thrusters and drops.

00:39.440 --> 00:45.670
And now we're to the point where he's going to look around the room.

00:45.740 --> 00:50.730
So I'm going to change my timeline here.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.470
Let's see what I just want him.

00:53.570 --> 00:58.210
I'll just begin with him dropping so maybe right about here.

00:59.470 --> 01:00.330
At 180

01:03.190 --> 01:07.640
and all continue on to 360 here.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.880
At least for now.

01:11.630 --> 01:18.120
So what we have here is him dropping and then he should be doing his thing here.

01:18.740 --> 01:27.350
Now one of the pieces of animation in the scene is going to be the camera and where he points the light

01:27.410 --> 01:31.570
at the end is going to be dictated by where the camera is.

01:31.580 --> 01:40.520
So if you go to the camera with the zero key this frame is going to be tighter on the Mac at the end

01:40.520 --> 01:41.880
of the animation.

01:41.930 --> 01:50.360
So it's going to be moving through kind of moving toward him I'm thinking beginning when he comes down

01:50.360 --> 01:57.470
into the frame so maybe we should begin with this maybe I should increase the range here and we should

01:57.470 --> 02:01.410
begin with that before we do anything else.

02:02.640 --> 02:08.590
So to animate that camera I think I'm going to go back to the default view here.

02:09.440 --> 02:20.510
And I think I'll split the screens like this and let's make this top one camera view here.

02:21.330 --> 02:28.980
I'm going to re-enable that camera so I can select it in the scene.

02:28.980 --> 02:36.590
I'm going to go to wireframe go the top view for right now just so I can see where the camera is.

02:36.840 --> 02:43.500
So at this point I'm I I go ahead and keep the camera right here where it is at the beginning of the

02:43.500 --> 02:44.520
scene.

02:44.750 --> 02:45.670
Well hit.

02:45.960 --> 02:52.070
And I'll just really I only need the location and the rotation.

02:52.070 --> 02:56.070
I'm not going to be scaling the camera at all so I'll hit that.

02:56.390 --> 03:02.330
The next thing I'll do is go right to where the camera needs to be after he's landed on the ground.

03:02.330 --> 03:16.950
I'm thinking that if he comes down and lands here the camera probably needs to finish its movement right

03:16.950 --> 03:19.500
around to 60.

03:19.530 --> 03:22.070
So let's move the camera in at this point.

03:22.070 --> 03:31.950
Now I've got autokey on him to save the scene before I make a major change here and I'm going to press

03:31.980 --> 03:37.140
g and I'm going to move the camera in like this.

03:37.140 --> 03:39.610
And I think I want to rotate it just a hair

03:44.150 --> 03:45.740
well let's try this.

03:45.740 --> 04:02.180
So I'm going to go back to the first frame and let's hit play.

04:02.360 --> 04:09.590
Not bad but there are a couple of places within the shot where he's not framed real well.

04:10.100 --> 04:17.480
So right here I'd maybe like to follow him a bit and just before he drops there's not enough head room

04:17.870 --> 04:19.470
at the top of the frame.

04:21.410 --> 04:24.010
I like the general feel of it.

04:26.430 --> 04:31.730
But right here he's almost out of frame.

04:31.930 --> 04:33.030
So a couple of things.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.890
Let's take a look here.

04:34.930 --> 04:36.850
So as he comes down into the frame

04:40.350 --> 04:49.110
I think right here we should be tilting up a little bit to see more of that hole in the ceiling before

04:49.110 --> 04:50.490
he comes down.

04:51.820 --> 04:52.170
Well.

04:52.170 --> 04:56.380
Another thing we could do is just move the keyframe.

04:56.480 --> 05:05.120
So I'm going to go back to the animation view and here instead of having him I think I will wait to

05:05.120 --> 05:12.770
begin the camera movement and tell about frame 40 as he's coming into frame and our eyes are distracted

05:12.770 --> 05:20.620
by that movement and that's when I'll maybe hide the initial movement of the camera.

05:20.630 --> 05:26.370
I really like to have camera movement be motivated or hidden.

05:26.420 --> 05:34.580
In other words you swinging the camera around to see something that you've heard or as movement in the

05:34.580 --> 05:35.570
frame happens.

05:35.570 --> 05:38.600
Then you can begin a camera movement.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.630
So it isn't quite as jarring.

05:41.670 --> 05:44.000
There's our camera right here.

05:45.850 --> 05:52.930
So I could just take this key frame and move it forward with the G key and just drag and move it forward

05:52.950 --> 05:54.090
so there.

05:54.100 --> 05:58.630
So now let's go back to that default view.

05:58.630 --> 06:01.150
It's a little easier for me to see here.

06:01.180 --> 06:01.510
All right.

06:01.510 --> 06:03.490
So go back to the beginning and hit play

06:14.580 --> 06:16.500
Yeah I think I'll go with that for now.

06:16.500 --> 06:23.100
Let me also take a look at when he kind of goes out of frame right here.

06:23.100 --> 06:30.770
It's not as bad now as it was because we've moved that first key frame forward all right.

06:30.770 --> 06:33.370
So now I need him to look around a bit.

06:33.380 --> 06:38.960
Let's go back to the animation window here.

06:38.960 --> 06:46.770
So if I hit play he drops here and about this point he needs to begin looking around.

06:47.100 --> 06:47.980
Well let's see.

06:47.980 --> 06:54.720
I'm going to go I'm going to begin to 30 here and I'm going to go to my rotate tool.

06:56.830 --> 07:00.480
And I'll just turn him a bit.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.560
Now we need to anchor that don't we.

07:02.560 --> 07:06.040
So I'm going to yeah at 225.

07:06.040 --> 07:12.490
I'm going to anchor him there and insert a key frame with location and rotation here

07:15.250 --> 07:22.200
and then at to 30 maybe to 35 I'll rotate them just a hair

07:25.760 --> 07:26.360
OK.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.490
So there's a bit of a turn there.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.840
He hits turns a bit

07:34.610 --> 07:36.250
as he turns.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.590
Move this one back a bit

07:44.490 --> 07:46.320
and then maybe here.

07:48.550 --> 07:51.090
And be it to 60 he'll come up a bit

07:57.230 --> 07:58.020
let's try that

08:04.550 --> 08:09.410
I moved the Y location back so he begins the upward movement a little earlier.

08:10.130 --> 08:11.420
So I'll push play

08:14.540 --> 08:17.620
and then maybe have in turn back at 300

08:24.590 --> 08:26.230
something like that yes.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.390
Let's try that.

08:35.750 --> 08:39.080
Move him in the X just a bit as he turns.

08:40.800 --> 08:42.370
Let's watch that again.

08:42.920 --> 08:47.570
Turns this way.

08:47.890 --> 08:51.280
Feel like he needs to get down as he's going.

08:52.710 --> 08:59.020
So we've got this as he comes up a bit move this

09:02.050 --> 09:10.090
keyframe in the local Y and a move that forward like as he's coming up just slowly Let's try that

09:15.390 --> 09:15.680
right.

09:15.680 --> 09:21.110
I've done some adjusting here on the Y the up and down.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.740
I'm having him come up a bit.

09:22.770 --> 09:26.130
And then here I'm having him dip down as he turns.

09:26.130 --> 09:29.250
I'm not sure exactly how this is working.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.560
Let's take a look at it.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.110
So he drops down.

09:32.250 --> 09:37.410
He turns he turns back and dips a bit as he turns.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.010
That doesn't look too bad.

09:40.100 --> 09:46.970
So my thought is that when he lands he lands the light

09:51.120 --> 09:53.220
the light scans.

09:53.220 --> 09:55.850
So he he lands here.

09:55.860 --> 10:05.220
And once he comes up the light comes down and looks forward and down to the ground and then he turns

10:05.280 --> 10:10.760
and then the light swings over there to where he's looking over there.

10:11.010 --> 10:18.690
And then he turns over here and then the light swings over and shines right into our eyes into the camera

10:18.690 --> 10:19.770
here right about here.

10:19.770 --> 10:23.700
So then at once he swings over here and takes a look.

10:23.700 --> 10:31.100
Then the spotlight swings over at us and blinds us and we fade to white.

10:31.740 --> 10:34.760
Well we're coming along in the next video.

10:34.920 --> 10:38.420
Let's take a look at animating the spotlight.

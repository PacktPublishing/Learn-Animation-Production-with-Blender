WEBVTT

00:00.840 --> 00:04.770
Well it looks like we're pretty much done with the rig here.

00:04.770 --> 00:12.600
The next thing we need to do is clean up the rig so that we only see the bones that we're going to animate

00:13.680 --> 00:18.400
and also clean it up so it isn't so cluttered in the scene.

00:18.460 --> 00:25.310
There are several bones here that we're just not going to use when animating now like the bones in the

00:25.310 --> 00:31.190
legs and the bones in the arms we're just going to use the I.K. bones to move these around.

00:31.190 --> 00:38.030
Likewise we're not going to need to see the bone for the spotlight because we're going to create another

00:38.030 --> 00:45.380
bone out here that that is going to point to so we can control the aim of light a good way to clean

00:45.380 --> 00:55.060
up a rig is to create custom shapes for the bones that we're going to need and want to select for animating.

00:55.220 --> 01:03.500
So to create a custom shape let's first begin down here with this foot and what we want for the feet

01:03.620 --> 01:11.870
is we want a custom shape for the foot control here that will allow us to select it move it around but

01:11.870 --> 01:16.470
also will give us a sense of when the foot is planted on the ground.

01:16.490 --> 01:20.950
I'm going to come out of pose mode and go to object mode and de-select everything.

01:20.960 --> 01:29.830
So I want to move my pivot point or my cursor into the center of the grid here so I'll press shift s

01:29.900 --> 01:41.640
and cursor to center and then I'm going to create a circle and I will call this shape foot

01:44.640 --> 01:53.890
and if I select this foot bone now I'm going to select the rig and go into pose mode and select that

01:54.580 --> 01:57.730
foot control bone right there.

01:57.730 --> 02:06.960
If I come over here into the bone panel and if I scroll down here I can see under display a field called

02:06.990 --> 02:08.470
custom shape.

02:08.820 --> 02:15.210
And what I can do is I can replace this shape for that.

02:15.220 --> 02:18.930
So the bone is still there but it doesn't look like a bone.

02:18.930 --> 02:23.240
It looks like whatever custom shape we assign to it.

02:23.650 --> 02:33.250
So in here like this type shape and I'll select the shape foot but we still can't see it.

02:33.250 --> 02:38.110
The one thing you have to do is check this wireframe box.

02:38.110 --> 02:42.830
If you check this you can now see the custom shape.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.130
So there it is.

02:44.380 --> 02:47.740
But it's not exactly how I would want it aligned.

02:47.740 --> 02:50.080
What I want is I'd like this a frame.

02:50.100 --> 03:00.010
So it's going around the foot and it's grounded down here on the grid so to move this around.

03:00.220 --> 03:04.140
If I select this and move this around an object mode it isn't going to do anything.

03:04.750 --> 03:14.010
But if I tab into edit mode and I'll even go into vertex mode so we can see it and I select everything.

03:14.140 --> 03:18.980
Now as I rotate it let me turn those manipulators back on.

03:19.090 --> 03:25.220
Now as I rotate it you can see it rotate with the custom shape.

03:25.220 --> 03:29.760
Now it's not exactly user friendly.

03:30.610 --> 03:37.850
This is one thing that I'm not real happy with Blendr about but it does work.

03:37.960 --> 03:42.170
I'm going to go ahead and do this like this.

03:42.790 --> 03:46.240
Then I'm going to come over here.

03:46.420 --> 03:51.810
Let me go to the side view and now I need to move it.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.970
So it rests down on the ground plane.

03:55.180 --> 04:02.980
So I'm going to press g and see which way it looks like that's the way so I'm going to move it in the

04:02.980 --> 04:13.460
Y and that should bring it down like so and I want it just right on the ground playing there.

04:13.820 --> 04:17.980
And then if I drag up that doesn't do any good.

04:17.980 --> 04:18.980
All right.

04:19.220 --> 04:23.860
So now if I drag in the X that takes it forward and back

04:27.030 --> 04:31.450
that goes like that so now it's kind of around the foot there.

04:31.770 --> 04:37.420
And the last thing I want to do is scale it so that see if I can go.

04:37.420 --> 04:38.250
I'm going to scale it.

04:38.260 --> 04:41.650
So it's kind of oval around the foot there.

04:42.830 --> 04:43.700
It's kind of a pain.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.500
It really is.

04:44.510 --> 04:52.510
But if you keep things in the center here it isn't too bad.

04:53.240 --> 04:56.090
So now this is actually the bone.

04:56.120 --> 05:04.400
So if I select this and press the G key and move it around that will actually be how we control the

05:04.400 --> 05:05.360
foot.

05:05.720 --> 05:12.890
And it's just a little cleaner than having to select a bone and we're going to hide away all of these

05:12.950 --> 05:18.360
bones in the leg and foot into another bone layer.

05:18.380 --> 05:20.620
So they'll be invisible.

05:20.630 --> 05:22.930
All right let's do this for the other foot.

05:22.930 --> 05:34.810
So if I select that other foot come over here to custom shape select the shape foot and click wireframe

05:36.450 --> 05:39.760
there we have our control for the other foot as well.

05:42.960 --> 05:43.420
All right.

05:43.440 --> 05:48.860
There's one so I'm going to take this custom shape and I'm going to move it to a layer.

05:48.870 --> 05:53.350
I want to press em and I'll move it to the layer just below here.

05:54.300 --> 05:58.980
So all right so the next one we want to do.

05:58.980 --> 06:03.110
How about this heel control let's work with that.

06:03.540 --> 06:13.350
So once again with the cursor in the center of the grid press circle and this one will call shape he'll

06:14.790 --> 06:18.470
and I'll select the heel bone here.

06:20.240 --> 06:30.820
I'll come into custom shape type in shape and select the heel and click wireframe So now we can see

06:30.820 --> 06:31.790
it there.

06:32.350 --> 06:39.660
So I'll go into edit mode for this and let's try and rotate it see what we get.

06:39.890 --> 06:41.350
That looks pretty good.

06:41.960 --> 06:48.530
So I'll go to the side view and continue rotating this until it's 90 degrees like that.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.680
I'll move it back.

06:53.010 --> 06:58.800
And now I want to bin this a bit around the heel to do that I think I'll probably first have to go back

06:58.800 --> 07:01.830
to Global transform orientation.

07:02.040 --> 07:10.410
And I also want to change to proportional editing so I'll turn on the proportional editing tool and

07:10.590 --> 07:20.190
what I want to do is just select maybe these two points and let me press the G key and with the brush

07:20.220 --> 07:21.580
fairly big here.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.760
I'm going to drag this back.

07:25.140 --> 07:28.540
So we get kind of this curve like this.

07:28.790 --> 07:37.460
And then maybe I'll select all of this and scale it in the next to kind to make it conform around the

07:37.470 --> 07:40.860
heel there and then I'll move it.

07:41.060 --> 07:41.580
Whoops.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.340
Let me turn off proportional editing real quick.

07:45.410 --> 07:54.440
We go and then move this forward around that heel so it just kind of fits around the heel a bit.

07:54.980 --> 07:57.920
OK so now we got that one done.

07:58.230 --> 08:00.950
Let's also select this one over here.

08:01.220 --> 08:07.640
Custom shape type in shape heel and wireframe.

08:08.120 --> 08:11.980
And now we have them for the foot and the heel.

08:12.350 --> 08:17.440
Once again I'll press em and move this to a new layer down here.

08:17.820 --> 08:26.600
Well let's work on the body here for this I think I want just a circle around the waist so let's go

08:26.600 --> 08:28.410
back to object mode.

08:29.940 --> 08:35.260
Go to the Create tab de-select everything and for this it's also create a circle.

08:35.260 --> 08:39.030
We'll call it shape body.

08:39.300 --> 08:50.740
I'll select that main body pose mode and for custom shape shape body wireframe.

08:50.860 --> 08:56.820
And there it is a little big and oriented wrong.

08:57.030 --> 09:04.570
But we can go to the side view and see if we can rotate this into place.

09:04.610 --> 09:08.300
So if I rotate it this way Sure enough it goes like that.

09:08.360 --> 09:09.220
That's good.

09:12.330 --> 09:17.560
And then I'll go ahead and scale it down a bit.

09:19.310 --> 09:27.620
And I'd like to move it to let's see which way moves it up and then we go and let's move that to a new

09:27.640 --> 09:32.780
layer to the letter with all the others on it.

09:32.780 --> 09:38.220
Next let's work on the I.K. hands and let's see if I can choose this.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.550
That's the hand-on.

09:39.590 --> 09:41.660
Well let me click it again.

09:41.750 --> 09:44.140
There it is there's the arm I.K..

09:44.510 --> 09:54.750
So that's the one we're going to use but I'll switch to object mode and create a circle call it shape

09:55.050 --> 09:59.210
arm.

09:59.590 --> 10:04.880
Go into pose mode and select that arm.

10:05.320 --> 10:15.250
I k now come over here to the custom shape type and shape arm wireframe.

10:15.530 --> 10:18.030
And there it is.

10:18.110 --> 10:22.220
So I'll select the custom shape go to Edit mode.

10:22.240 --> 10:27.590
And let's begin rotating this and seeing what we can get rotated in the x.

10:27.620 --> 10:32.700
Yeah that looks like it might be good.

10:36.210 --> 10:36.710
All right.

10:36.710 --> 10:37.990
So that's in place now.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.500
Scale it up some so we can select it.

10:41.460 --> 10:42.270
How we go

10:46.540 --> 10:50.760
and there's our hand or arm shape.

10:50.840 --> 10:54.530
I'll go ahead and select this other one over here.

10:54.610 --> 11:00.260
Arm I.K. are kind of the custom shape.

11:00.520 --> 11:07.850
Select the arm click wireframe and there's that one so we should be able to select this.

11:07.850 --> 11:13.250
Hit the G key and move that arm around.

11:13.450 --> 11:17.010
I'll select this now and move it to a new lair again.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.140
And here we go.

11:20.850 --> 11:27.570
So for these pieces out here the knee and elbow joints What should we do about these.

11:27.570 --> 11:31.860
I think I'd like something a little more substantial than just a circle.

11:32.310 --> 11:39.220
Let's use a couple of circles to create a custom shape for these.

11:39.270 --> 11:47.840
So I'll go ahead and create a circle again and I'll also duplicate it.

11:47.840 --> 11:55.790
So press shift D and hit enter and then I'm going to rotate this around the X like this.

11:55.830 --> 12:01.470
I mean you hit the end key to bring up the properties panel and I can see that I've got negative 60

12:01.470 --> 12:02.940
or whatever in here.

12:03.180 --> 12:13.690
I'll just type in 90 sort of got that and then I'll take this again and duplicate it with shift D and

12:13.690 --> 12:14.470
enter.

12:14.830 --> 12:21.970
And this time I'll rotate it this way around the Y 90 degrees we go.

12:22.160 --> 12:26.600
So we've got something that looks kind of like that.

12:26.810 --> 12:33.060
And then I'll take them all and join them together with control J.

12:34.860 --> 12:35.540
And we go.

12:35.540 --> 12:49.050
So now I'll call this shape joints for knees and elbows.

12:49.590 --> 12:50.040
All right.

12:50.050 --> 12:52.990
So that's that.

12:53.010 --> 12:58.530
So let's try this let's select the knee joint over here in PPO's mode of course.

13:00.590 --> 13:09.860
Come over here to custom shape type in shape and we'll use shape joints and click wireframe and there

13:09.860 --> 13:10.870
we go.

13:11.420 --> 13:13.470
So now I'll just scale this down a bit.

13:13.490 --> 13:18.530
I'll go to Edit Mode make sure everything's selected and scale it down.

13:18.920 --> 13:22.210
So it looks kind of like this.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.100
I think that's a pretty good sign.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.780
Should it be a little smaller.

13:27.590 --> 13:29.450
Yeah something like that.

13:30.020 --> 13:34.430
So now we can just select each one of these here and

13:37.970 --> 13:42.810
give it that shape joints custom shape.

00:00.910 --> 00:05.680
All right so I'm thinking the light should come on right about here.

00:05.850 --> 00:14.610
And so yeah if it came on right here and then he turned now the light could swing over.

00:14.610 --> 00:18.110
Beginning at this point so many keyframe here.

00:18.330 --> 00:22.650
I'm going to press the key and select location because that's all we need.

00:22.650 --> 00:27.840
We're just adjusting the location of this control object.

00:28.140 --> 00:36.030
And then it's going to swing over like that may be right about here.

00:36.050 --> 00:44.780
So let me go to the top view now and wireframe the orthographic view.

00:45.290 --> 00:52.730
And so at this point in time it's got to swing over to where he's looking so like that

00:56.520 --> 00:59.950
OK let me go back.

01:00.050 --> 01:06.660
So it swings over like that and maybe down a bit let's have it go down.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.790
All right let's try that

01:12.180 --> 01:13.340
drops.

01:13.500 --> 01:18.290
Looks swings over and then swing back

01:21.140 --> 01:29.600
OK let's try that and it looks swings so I bet I could make this a little bit earlier here

01:32.650 --> 01:38.350
let me move this up a bit like this.

01:39.960 --> 01:40.330
All right.

01:40.330 --> 01:44.710
So he drops it comes on.

01:44.710 --> 01:47.810
Looks over there looks over here and then swings back.

01:47.830 --> 01:48.870
OK.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.170
So I think

01:53.120 --> 01:57.660
he looks over and he's going to have to start swinging that thing around.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.010
At this point.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.890
So the location should go there.

02:02.980 --> 02:10.530
So now I'm going to go back to the top you and wireframe and swing that back around over to the camera.

02:10.730 --> 02:14.540
At this point after he looks

02:17.220 --> 02:23.230
let's see anchor at and I want him to.

02:23.260 --> 02:35.350
So I think I want this keyframe to move to here and then we want to swing that around there.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.130
Let's try that.

02:37.180 --> 02:41.440
I want to put it right in front of the camera here.

02:41.530 --> 02:44.890
See row Z.

02:45.310 --> 02:50.480
Bring that down right in front of the camera so it's pointing right in your eyes.

02:53.060 --> 02:53.770
I like that

02:58.420 --> 02:58.690
all right.

02:58.690 --> 02:59.410
Let's try that

03:08.280 --> 03:08.800
all right.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.320
So that's not bad.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.590
I think it needs to be quicker though.

03:12.810 --> 03:15.210
Used to really whip around

03:25.760 --> 03:28.310
so something like this.

03:28.310 --> 03:30.950
Right around 300 I'm going to put it.

03:31.080 --> 03:42.580
Move that keyframe over and let's try this at play so he drops like comes on swish over there and move

03:42.580 --> 03:43.500
it over here.

03:44.640 --> 03:45.880
It's not bad.

03:45.890 --> 03:48.880
Drop light comes on.

03:48.910 --> 03:50.110
Look over there.

03:50.380 --> 03:51.420
Look over here.

03:52.570 --> 03:53.950
Yeah I think we're getting there.

03:53.950 --> 03:58.200
Let's take a look at it one more time from the very beginning.

03:58.630 --> 04:05.270
So I'll take this down to one and this is at 360 that's fine.

04:08.920 --> 04:18.230
And our press control up arrow to make this full screen and now it's hit Control A and play it.

04:18.270 --> 04:23.460
So he drops their and they're

04:26.250 --> 04:35.250
all right so here's the whole thing he drops down moves forward turns off his thrusters.

04:35.250 --> 04:40.600
Looks over there and then looks over here and then that's the end.

04:41.130 --> 04:50.410
So I think what I will do is take a little bit and make a pass for the fingers and final touches.

04:50.820 --> 04:56.700
But I think after that we'll be ready to begin the final setup of the lights in the scene.

WEBVTT

00:00.710 --> 00:06.090
Now let's start working on applying some textures to the Mech..

00:06.090 --> 00:13.140
I think what I'm going to do is use the same technique that we did for the sand and the stairs just

00:13.140 --> 00:15.480
apply a repeating texture.

00:15.480 --> 00:25.630
So if I open up get up here open up a file I have in the images folder here I've got this metal j peg.

00:25.710 --> 00:27.360
Let's open that up.

00:27.390 --> 00:37.300
So what I'll do is just make this image seamless I'll just go to filter's map and make seamless and

00:37.300 --> 00:44.990
now I can apply this directly to the Meck material and then increase the scale to repeat it.

00:45.250 --> 00:55.630
So I'll export this out file export as and I'll put this in our textures folder and I'll call it metal

00:56.320 --> 00:57.070
seamless

01:00.830 --> 01:01.360
All right.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.200
So back to Blendr now in Blender.

01:04.200 --> 01:11.860
I'll go ahead and switch over to the U-V editing layout and with Mxs selected I'll go ahead and choose

01:11.860 --> 01:22.050
the metal mech body and I don't really want to input the texture into the glossy material.

01:22.050 --> 01:31.070
What I think I'll do is add a new shader here a press shift a and Shater and diffuse and this is what

01:31.070 --> 01:34.110
will bring the texture into.

01:34.430 --> 01:37.380
But I'd like to combine it with this glossy.

01:37.420 --> 01:41.570
I still want it to have that kind of metal sheen to it.

01:41.720 --> 01:50.960
So press shift A and under Shater I'll bring in mix Shater and I'll add that here in between and I'll

01:50.960 --> 01:57.400
connect this up here so it's mixing between the glossy and the diffuse.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.140
Now for the texture.

02:00.350 --> 02:06.400
Let me first press control up arrow and I'm just going to make this screen a little bigger for now.

02:06.860 --> 02:15.530
I'm going to press shift A and I'll bring in an image texture node and shift again and I'll bring in

02:15.850 --> 02:20.100
and texture coordinate node under the input menu.

02:21.330 --> 02:29.400
And I'll connect up the U-V to the image texture and I'll connect the image texture to the diffuse.

02:29.400 --> 02:38.510
Now I'd like to grab that seamless texture we were just using under my textures folder here.

02:38.790 --> 02:42.850
There's that metal seamless and I'll bring that in.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.080
So press control up arrow to minimize that screen again.

02:47.340 --> 02:49.250
And so there is texture.

02:49.260 --> 02:57.480
Now it's kind of big I don't think we want to the scratches of the metal to be that big on the neck.

02:57.750 --> 03:05.510
So let's go over here to the textures panel and let's play with the scale a bit.

03:05.510 --> 03:12.570
So I'll increase the scale I'll try three little better than I'd like it to be a little bit smaller

03:12.570 --> 03:15.510
still so I'll increase it to five.

03:15.510 --> 03:16.820
Let's try that.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.440
Yeah that may be a little bit better.

03:19.620 --> 03:22.240
Just the size of the scratches.

03:23.260 --> 03:26.580
There's a little bit more reasonable.

03:26.650 --> 03:29.130
So now that we know the scale is going to be five.

03:29.140 --> 03:35.320
Let's go ahead and add a bump node in here as well so I'll press control up arrow to make this a little

03:35.320 --> 03:36.570
bit bigger.

03:36.940 --> 03:49.530
And I'll take this texture note and press D and copy it and then I will press shift a and bring in a

03:49.530 --> 03:59.000
bump node and I'll take their color here into the normal socket and the normal into the displacement

03:59.620 --> 04:05.710
and I'll also bring this U-V right over here into that texture note as well.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.140
So I had control Aperol again.

04:08.420 --> 04:15.260
And now let's take a look at it in our render view.

04:15.260 --> 04:20.750
I'm going to look at it from the back because that's really where the light is coming from and I'm going

04:20.750 --> 04:25.950
to switch from textured to render the viewport shading.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.860
Well that's looking pretty good.

04:27.860 --> 04:36.290
We've still got the shine of the metal along with some nicks and scratches and even some bump.

04:36.290 --> 04:40.890
Let me zoom in here and look at this mix Shater.

04:40.970 --> 04:48.890
So if I take this mix Shater all the way to one side you can see that now it's only bringing in the

04:48.890 --> 04:50.150
diffuse.

04:50.170 --> 04:55.760
Now if I take the mix Shater all the way to the other side it's bringing in only the glossy.

04:55.760 --> 05:00.950
So we had at it point five I want to try point six or seven.

05:00.950 --> 05:03.060
See how that works.

05:03.140 --> 05:05.330
Reduce the shine just a little bit.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.830
Yeah that looks pretty good.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.700
I'll go with that.

05:09.760 --> 05:14.500
Now the other piece is the joints and the tubes.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.970
They're looking kind of flat.

05:15.970 --> 05:22.300
I think they need a little bit of glossy ness or shine to them a little bit of Specularia.

05:22.690 --> 05:31.370
I'm going to select the rubber joints here the material and for this.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.820
We've already got a diffuse coming in and that's good.

05:33.820 --> 05:42.930
But I think we also need a glossy so I'll press shift a and bring in a glossy Shater and I'll press

05:42.980 --> 05:47.260
shift day and bring in mix Shater.

05:47.410 --> 05:52.660
So now we can mix between the diffuse and the glossy.

05:52.660 --> 05:59.950
Now that's a little too much because we want it to still be a rubber type of material.

05:59.950 --> 06:05.720
Maybe I'll bring that a little bit higher.

06:06.040 --> 06:11.560
I think also the color of the glass needs to be more gray.

06:13.490 --> 06:14.640
Like so.

06:14.720 --> 06:24.700
So now we're getting more of a rubber type material however I think I want to make it even less shining

06:24.700 --> 06:30.170
you on a really just have just a little bit in there.

06:30.170 --> 06:36.150
I'm going to bring up the roughness in the glossy.

06:36.280 --> 06:45.040
So there we have kind of what I'm looking for more of a spread out and distributed specular highlight

06:45.070 --> 06:50.820
there something that kind of says this is not a real shiny material.

06:50.890 --> 06:54.400
Maybe I'll even increase the roughness on the diffuse a bit.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.020
See what happens there.

06:57.810 --> 06:59.580
Yeah something like that.

07:00.020 --> 07:00.710
OK.

07:01.020 --> 07:01.920
How about the tubes.

07:01.920 --> 07:08.280
Let's take a look at the tubes you're going to have to select them directly because there are currently

07:08.670 --> 07:10.170
separate objects.

07:12.670 --> 07:28.040
So for the tubes let's also add a glossy Shater and we'll do a little mixing here as well something

07:28.040 --> 07:29.600
like that.

07:29.630 --> 07:32.410
Once again I'll bring the color of the glossy down

07:35.390 --> 07:44.460
and maybe increase the factor just a little fat maybe I'll increase the roughness of the diffuse quite

07:44.460 --> 07:45.020
a bit.

07:45.030 --> 07:46.580
See what happens there.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.210
And maybe of the glossy as well.

07:51.370 --> 07:52.540
All right.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.250
So now we have the tubes.

07:55.250 --> 07:55.940
What about this.

07:55.940 --> 08:03.240
Trim the trim on the Mac is looking awfully shiny now in comparison to everything else.

08:03.470 --> 08:09.600
So I'll select the Mac trim and let's work on this.

08:09.610 --> 08:16.590
I see it's just a glossy So let's add a diffuse.

08:16.820 --> 08:24.760
And also let's add a mix and try this.

08:24.810 --> 08:27.740
Let's bring the color down a bit.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.650
For now I think that looks pretty good.

08:32.940 --> 08:35.040
Let me look at this back panel now.

08:35.040 --> 08:39.310
We created a few materials for this too.

08:39.390 --> 08:48.990
Now for these pieces we could add a bit of a mission to make the lights glow a little bit maybe.

08:49.050 --> 09:02.430
And instead of a glossy for this add emission and all add a mix Shater and we'll try and mix between

09:02.460 --> 09:05.990
the diffuse and the emission.

09:06.390 --> 09:08.380
That's a little much.

09:08.550 --> 09:09.570
Something like this.

09:09.570 --> 09:16.900
However what we should do is make the color of the emission the same as the diffuse so all selected

09:16.920 --> 09:24.840
this little eyedropper and then click that right in that color of the diffuse and that will make it

09:25.050 --> 09:27.410
a similar color.

09:27.420 --> 09:35.470
So now as it emits light it'll emit that purple.

09:35.480 --> 09:40.040
We could try a glossy Shater here and see if that works any better.

09:46.030 --> 09:54.040
To cut one of these connections you can press control and drag across and it'll cut the connection.

09:54.930 --> 10:02.280
So now I'll try a glossy here and that gives it a little bit of shine as we go.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.690
See how that works.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.240
Maybe something like that.

10:09.530 --> 10:18.440
The only part of the mech that we haven't dealt with yet is this light lens and we'll deal with that

10:18.440 --> 10:25.190
when we set up the lights in the scene because we're going to have a spotlight shining out of this and

10:25.190 --> 10:30.760
what we're going to want to do is one make this an emission shader.

10:31.010 --> 10:38.570
And secondly we're going to want to allow a spotlight to shine through that object as if it's a lens.

10:38.570 --> 10:42.420
So we'll look at those couple of things when we set up the lights and the scene.

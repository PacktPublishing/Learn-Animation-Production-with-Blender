00:01.030 --> 00:06.240
Well let's continue working on giving the arms and legs a little more detail.

00:06.730 --> 00:14.000
I'm going to work on the lower leg here and click it and zoom in with the period key on the numpad.

00:14.290 --> 00:20.650
And if I hit the tab key I can see that we've just got three edge loops here.

00:20.770 --> 00:28.400
I'm going to click over here and turn off the Adjust edit cage setting here.

00:28.600 --> 00:34.080
So what I want to do is provide some sort of detail at the top and the bottom of this piece.

00:34.240 --> 00:39.700
So I'm just going to insert an edge loop here and bring it down and I'm going to make kind of like a

00:39.700 --> 00:40.720
cuff.

00:40.720 --> 00:49.120
I'm going to go to face mode and Allt click and edge between these two faces to select that whole edge

00:49.120 --> 00:49.870
loop.

00:49.990 --> 00:55.540
And now I want to extrude these out and what I'm going to do is I want to come over here under the extrude

00:55.780 --> 01:03.910
pulldown and choose region vertex normal's and what that will do is it will actually extrude in one

01:04.150 --> 01:08.200
step in the direction of each individual face.

01:08.200 --> 01:13.450
So if I click this and I drag the mouse you can see it's coming out.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.340
Each individual face is coming out in its own direction.

01:17.530 --> 01:18.460
So that's what I want.

01:18.460 --> 01:20.170
I think I'm going to go about right.

01:20.960 --> 01:29.090
Here and click and then I'm going to add a couple of extra edge loops to hold this because if I unselect

01:29.090 --> 01:33.950
this and turn this back on over here this edit cage setting.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.170
You can see that it's kind of it isn't real tight.

01:38.180 --> 01:39.810
The edges aren't real clean.

01:40.040 --> 01:46.250
So I'm going to try and add some to that and press control are and right in here I'm going to hover

01:46.250 --> 01:54.200
and I'm going to scroll the mouse wheel and maybe I'll scroll it so I can get two edge loops in here

01:55.220 --> 01:56.480
and then click again.

01:56.720 --> 02:04.220
And in addition I think I'm going to add an edge loop right in here to so it will really hold that pretty

02:04.220 --> 02:08.350
tightly about there.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.730
Now you can see that edge is pretty sharp.

02:11.840 --> 02:20.300
It's still rounded enough to give us the sense that it's a real world object because no real world object

02:20.300 --> 02:24.590
is exactly 90 degrees at an edge.

02:24.590 --> 02:29.300
But it sharpens up the edge to give us a sense that it is a hard surface object.

02:29.300 --> 02:35.890
So now up here at the top of this piece I'm going to turn off the cage for just a moment and insert

02:35.890 --> 02:46.280
an Angelou appear face mode alt click and edge between those two faces and use this extrude region Virtex

02:46.310 --> 02:52.760
normal's again and pull that out just a bit something like that.

02:52.790 --> 02:58.140
Insert a couple of edge loops and maybe one or more down here.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.610
Tighten that up and we go.

03:03.970 --> 03:09.550
So now we've got a sense that yes the object spins smooth but it's still a hard surface object because

03:09.550 --> 03:12.170
it's maintaining those relatively hard edges.

03:13.340 --> 03:13.670
All right.

03:13.670 --> 03:21.830
Let's go on up here and I'm going to do the same thing I'm a turn off this adjust edit cage for now

03:22.940 --> 03:30.110
insert and loop face mounted and extrude region.

03:30.200 --> 03:30.850
Same thing

03:33.530 --> 03:41.720
insert two edge loops to hold that shape insert an edge loop appear and pull it down a bit and then

03:41.720 --> 03:43.410
we have that one.

03:43.910 --> 03:50.600
And I'm just going to keep going for the rest of the leg here as well.

03:50.600 --> 03:55.560
I'm going to do this for the forearm and the upper arm too.

03:55.610 --> 04:02.770
Now one thing I've noticed is that some of these don't completely meet with the joints.

04:02.810 --> 04:10.070
So there's this kind of a gap here and he's going to select this edge and scale this in so it meets

04:10.070 --> 04:12.270
that shoulder joint.

04:12.470 --> 04:17.780
Just so you can't accidentally see down into one of the limbs.

04:17.780 --> 04:21.480
I'll take a look at the leg joints as well to

04:27.650 --> 04:34.970
well I've taken care of the arm and leg but this shoulder joint looks a little bit messy as well.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.750
We need to clean that up.

04:36.920 --> 04:43.790
So I've selected the body of the Mac and I'm just going to press the forward slash or divide key on

04:43.880 --> 04:46.310
the numpad to isolate it.

04:46.850 --> 04:53.620
And now I'm going to select maybe just an edge and zoom in with the period key.

04:54.050 --> 05:00.290
So here's what it looks like it's pretty low rez which means it's going to be kind of gloppy here.

05:00.440 --> 05:07.040
So I think I need to insert a couple of edge loops here at least on the outside to see what I can get.

05:07.040 --> 05:11.580
Let's try this and insert maybe two edge loops here.

05:13.430 --> 05:14.900
I think that's helped.

05:15.890 --> 05:19.170
But also I think we need to do something with this.

05:19.250 --> 05:25.640
Now one thing about inserting an edge loop or the loop cut and slide tool is that if I press control

05:25.640 --> 05:32.030
are here and hover over these edges I don't get an edge here if I come over here.

05:32.180 --> 05:33.740
I do.

05:33.740 --> 05:41.630
The reason why I don't get an edge when I have a rover these is that they're tri's that when you insert

05:41.630 --> 05:46.930
an agile loop they can only go through four sided polygons or quads.

05:47.150 --> 05:49.310
These are three sided or tries.

05:49.460 --> 05:56.420
So I can't get an edge loop to go through them what I want is I want an edge loop in here to hold the

05:56.420 --> 05:58.840
edge a little bit tighter.

05:59.270 --> 06:04.590
So how to insert an edge loop into a collection of tries.

06:04.910 --> 06:09.750
The best way to do that is actually to select faces and then extrude.

06:09.740 --> 06:10.930
So let me do that.

06:10.930 --> 06:14.690
I want to select these faces here.

06:16.940 --> 06:22.310
And then I want them to do is hit the e key and then I'm going to click the mouse.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.680
And now I'm going to hit the ESC key and I'm on a scale in.

06:25.700 --> 06:34.700
And now what I've done is I've actually created a place let me tab out of edit mode here.

06:34.760 --> 06:40.680
Now I've created an edge here that's going to hold that.

06:40.700 --> 06:45.110
So let me go back let me turn on this cage modifier here.

06:45.920 --> 06:53.420
So now you can see I've inserted this edge loop by extruding and then scaling and so now I have this

06:53.420 --> 06:54.990
piece to work with.

06:55.220 --> 07:04.260
So I could maybe insert another edge loop in here like this and that would hold that a little bit tighter

07:04.260 --> 07:05.920
as well.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.650
I think one more thing I'm going to select these faces with the C key the circle select tool and click

07:13.650 --> 07:20.190
and drag and then all right click to get out of that and then maybe I'll extrude one more time going

07:20.190 --> 07:27.310
and I'm going to turn off this and it cage here and maybe I will hit the e key.

07:27.330 --> 07:29.130
I'm going to push back in.

07:29.130 --> 07:34.850
So it's going to be kind of ugly here at the beginning and then I'm going to scale in from here.

07:35.630 --> 07:38.200
I like that.

07:38.210 --> 07:40.190
Now what does that do for me.

07:42.220 --> 07:42.690
Let's see.

07:42.700 --> 07:44.850
I'm going to hit this button again.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.920
And that gives me something like that.

07:47.930 --> 07:53.010
Now if I insert an edge loop along here.

07:53.020 --> 07:53.420
Now

07:56.620 --> 08:04.810
that will allow me to make this a little bit sharper than a scale this in some I guess.

08:04.810 --> 08:10.610
So now I have that kind of rim around that piece.

08:10.680 --> 08:11.010
All right.

08:11.010 --> 08:17.100
So let's see how that looks with the shoulder in I'm going to press the forward slash on the numpad

08:17.580 --> 08:18.800
and bring that back.

08:20.020 --> 08:25.750
That's looking OK but I feel like I need to collapse or scale in these edges a bit.

08:25.750 --> 08:32.320
I don't need them quite that big but just going to scale that in just a bit.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.870
I think that's all it needed.

08:34.280 --> 08:39.010
Ok so we now have some detail on the arm and the legs there.

08:39.470 --> 08:45.510
We can next take a look at this jet pack and see what we need to do to it.

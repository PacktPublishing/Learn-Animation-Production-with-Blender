WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:07.710
Well let's see what we can come up with for Jet Pack thrusters effect here.

00:08.160 --> 00:16.260
I'm going to use a relatively new tool in Blender called quick smoke or a quick fire and smoke but let's

00:16.260 --> 00:26.410
go back to the first frame here and let's come up here to this guy and I'll zoom in again.

00:27.140 --> 00:36.030
What I'd like to do is create objects inside the thrusters here that will add the quick fire and smoke

00:36.120 --> 00:46.290
effect onto and then will also parent this object to the root bone here of the neck.

00:46.500 --> 00:58.960
So I'm going to select this and I'm going to zoom in here and select this vertex so that I can snap

01:00.250 --> 01:01.270
the cursor to it.

01:01.270 --> 01:07.930
So I'm going to press shift s and cursor to selected and that snaps that there.

01:07.930 --> 01:15.700
Now I'm going to for the object that we're going to use I'm going to use a cone here and I don't need

01:15.700 --> 01:26.450
this face on the bottom so I will delete it with the x key and then I'll spin it around let me turn

01:26.450 --> 01:37.100
on the manipulators here I want to rotate it in the X 180 degrees so I'll press the R key X and type

01:37.100 --> 01:41.700
in 1 8 0 and then I'm on a scale this down a bit.

01:41.720 --> 01:50.770
So it fits inside of here and maybe even scale it this way.

01:52.800 --> 01:59.540
I like this and let me pull it out so it isn't intersecting at a little big.

01:59.940 --> 02:03.890
So let me scale it down again and move it back in

02:07.690 --> 02:09.000
something like that.

02:10.250 --> 02:11.100
All right.

02:11.360 --> 02:20.630
So I'll give this object a name I'll call it just one and I'll duplicate it and move it over here to

02:20.630 --> 02:23.960
this thruster and I'll call this jet to

02:27.090 --> 02:28.570
go.

02:28.680 --> 02:37.140
These are going to need to be printed to this route bone's so I'll select that the first jet one object

02:37.170 --> 02:43.880
and shift select that bone and press control P and I'll do the same over here.

02:45.080 --> 02:49.530
Control peeing pong.

02:49.550 --> 02:54.910
So now what I can do is select one of these objects and I'm going to go to object.

02:55.100 --> 03:00.140
Quick effects and I'm going to choose quick smoke.

03:00.170 --> 03:06.080
Now what that does is it gives it the smoke style here.

03:06.080 --> 03:11.010
But what I want to do is change this immediately to smoke and fire.

03:12.650 --> 03:21.860
Now I want to select this and come over here to the physics tab and make sure that it says fire and

03:21.860 --> 03:24.290
smoke here as well.

03:24.290 --> 03:34.520
Another thing you need to make sure of that if you select this box around the object this is the smoke

03:34.580 --> 03:39.130
domain you should be able to see this in the Noad Ed..

03:39.130 --> 03:48.970
So I'm just going to with that selected switch over to the Noad editor here and if I change to object

03:49.420 --> 03:52.150
we should see all of this.

03:52.180 --> 03:59.810
So what that quick smoke style does is it creates this entire node network.

03:59.980 --> 04:06.370
And the important part about this is is that you need to see this color ramp here if you didn't if you

04:06.370 --> 04:13.090
don't see this then you need to probably try again just undo and try again.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.310
It can be kind of touchy.

04:15.310 --> 04:21.560
So when you select the domain you need to see this node network.

04:21.640 --> 04:21.960
All right.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.430
So going to go back to the 3D view here.

04:24.850 --> 04:32.590
And one of the things also we need to do is parent this domain to this bone as well.

04:32.620 --> 04:36.630
So when a press control P and parent Tabone.

04:36.640 --> 04:44.580
So now as we move it all of these come along and you can see the flame beginning here as we scroll through

04:44.590 --> 04:46.120
so if I hit play.

04:46.630 --> 04:49.030
Let me go back to the camera view here.

04:49.300 --> 04:57.450
If I hit playing you should be able to see the fire and smoke in the viewport here.

04:57.450 --> 05:04.600
The problem is that it's going up and we need it to be thrusting downward.

05:04.950 --> 05:10.680
So let's go back to the beginning here again and to do that.

05:10.710 --> 05:14.970
Just a quick way to do that is to create a force.

05:15.360 --> 05:22.480
So I'm going to de-select everything I'll go back to object mode here and de-select everything.

05:22.710 --> 05:34.290
And I want to create a new polygon plane and that will be our wind force so I'll create a plane and

05:34.290 --> 05:40.730
I'll scale it up so we can see it a bit and I can just move it up out of the way here.

05:40.770 --> 05:44.150
So this is going to be our wind plane.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.630
I'll go ahead and give it a name I'll call this wind.

05:48.360 --> 05:57.750
And for the physics effect that we want we want a force field and we want to immediately change that

05:57.750 --> 06:01.390
type from force to wind.

06:01.410 --> 06:06.340
Now you can see these circles up at the top here.

06:06.420 --> 06:13.480
If I increase the strength you can see those circles will kind of expand to show us the strength.

06:13.590 --> 06:17.070
I'm going to give this a strength of I don't know 50.

06:17.130 --> 06:18.390
We'll try that.

06:18.930 --> 06:27.730
And I want to rotate this as well so I'll press R X type in 180 and that'll spin it around.

06:28.050 --> 06:36.000
So now that wind force should help move the thrusters down.

06:36.060 --> 06:43.000
So now let's go back to our camera view and let's hit play.

06:43.090 --> 06:51.660
Now we can see it being blown downward as if it's thrusting out of the jetpack.

06:51.660 --> 06:53.370
All right.

06:53.370 --> 06:58.270
Let's go back and let's just do a test render and see how that looks.

06:58.290 --> 07:00.840
I'm going to do it right about here.

07:01.200 --> 07:06.070
Go to the rendered viewport shading and see how it looks.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.590
Well OK it's looking pretty good.

07:08.910 --> 07:10.380
That's not too bad.

07:10.380 --> 07:14.240
Let's go ahead and set up the same thing for the other side as well.

07:14.520 --> 07:24.240
So I'm going to slide this other object here and I'll go to object quick effects quick smoke immediately

07:24.420 --> 07:28.320
make sure that it says smoke and fire over here.

07:28.530 --> 07:32.210
And when I select that object I also liked it here in the outliner.

07:32.340 --> 07:36.120
I need to make sure it says fire and smoke here as well.

07:36.600 --> 07:45.810
So that if I select this domain I'll go to the note editor and make sure that I see this node set up.

07:45.810 --> 07:48.490
And so we should be ok now.

07:48.630 --> 07:56.420
So I'll go back to my 3-D view and I need to parent this domain to the root bone.

07:56.460 --> 08:03.870
I better go to select this and go to pose mode first then de-select everything.

08:03.870 --> 08:08.100
Now select that domain shift's select the root bone.

08:08.100 --> 08:13.860
So it's in PPO's mode and control P and parent that to the bone.

08:13.860 --> 08:19.000
Now let's go back to our camera view and see how this works.

08:20.950 --> 08:21.080
Right.

08:21.370 --> 08:24.370
So there we have our two thrusters.

08:25.010 --> 08:30.920
So the next thing we need to do is figure out when it needs to turn off because he shouldn't have these

08:30.920 --> 08:34.880
on when he drops down.

08:34.960 --> 08:39.070
So let's go back and see when that should turn off.

08:42.170 --> 08:47.100
Maybe right about right or right in here.

08:47.100 --> 08:51.270
So when he hit the arrow key and go back to chest

08:56.840 --> 09:00.860
there that's where he begins to drop that's 182.

09:01.070 --> 09:06.990
I'm thinking maybe he should kind of hover for about six frames after the Jets go off.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.370
Let's try that.

09:10.380 --> 09:17.280
So at this point is when they should go off which means at this point one more frame back that's when

09:17.280 --> 09:22.530
we should put that anchor keyframe in with it on.

09:22.860 --> 09:32.650
Let's grab this one here and it's going to be I'm going to keyframe both the density and the flame rate

09:32.650 --> 09:33.440
here.

09:33.760 --> 09:45.640
So at this point I'll say it's going to be one inserted keyframe here and insert a keyframe here.

09:45.850 --> 09:54.320
I will also go back to frame 1 and insert keyframes there.

09:54.380 --> 10:02.480
Now if I come to this point and go forward one frame now I'm going to change these to zero.

10:03.860 --> 10:13.500
Like so and insert keyframes here as well so insert a key frame there and insert a key frame there.

10:13.510 --> 10:17.020
Now theoretically that should turn it off at that point.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.230
Let's give it a try here.

10:20.290 --> 10:23.350
I will go back and we'll try it.

10:23.350 --> 10:29.000
So if he comes in comes down well now it needs to refresh it.

10:29.050 --> 10:30.660
Sometimes we'll do this.

10:30.670 --> 10:43.460
Let me exit out of that camera view and try and save and see if I can get this to refresh.

10:43.470 --> 10:44.260
There they are.

10:44.370 --> 10:45.100
OK.

10:45.550 --> 10:47.890
So I'll go back to my camera view.

10:48.420 --> 10:51.140
Hit Play.

10:51.160 --> 10:56.350
So there they are.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.890
And it goes off.

10:57.900 --> 10:58.650
Good.

10:58.890 --> 11:01.970
So I'll do that for the other one as well.

11:02.010 --> 11:11.090
Let's go back to that frame so that was 175 there and I'll choose jet 2.

11:11.240 --> 11:16.260
And here I'll insert a key frame here and here.

11:18.210 --> 11:21.810
Then go all the way back and I'll do the same thing.

11:21.930 --> 11:23.990
Insert keyframes there.

11:25.080 --> 11:32.800
And then at 176 we zero these out and Key them

11:37.550 --> 11:40.040
inserting keyframes there.

11:40.040 --> 11:44.030
So now I'll try and move around save to refresh.

11:44.030 --> 11:46.210
Go back to my camera view.

11:46.670 --> 11:51.330
Let's go back to the beginning and let's it play.

11:51.860 --> 11:55.620
We still can't see our thrusters there.

11:55.670 --> 12:00.270
Let me go back up here and we see them up here.

12:00.510 --> 12:01.010
Yeah.

12:01.010 --> 12:02.320
OK.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.520
They're there.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.850
Now we hit play again.

12:07.820 --> 12:12.440
We see them there on down through here.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.470
They turn off and he drops.

12:15.470 --> 12:16.160
Good.

12:16.310 --> 12:18.890
That's what we want.

12:18.900 --> 12:25.660
So in the next video we'll actually begin adjusting the settings to begin rendering out the animation.

00:00.620 --> 00:07.390
Usually you put that master control at the base or at the ground plane which is what I'm going to do.

00:07.670 --> 00:13.880
And usually the pivot point or the or the origin of that object is at the center of the grid.

00:13.880 --> 00:20.670
However I want this one to be able to fly kind of fly down into the scene.

00:20.870 --> 00:27.410
And I want it to be able to pivot kind of around where the jetpack thrusters are.

00:27.410 --> 00:33.570
So I want that pivot point that origin of that bone to be right about here.

00:33.620 --> 00:42.890
So to do that I'm going to come back into edit mode on these bones so all select one and go to Edit

00:42.890 --> 00:44.460
mode.

00:44.870 --> 00:51.080
So I will create one more bone here in edit mode I'll press shift a and that will pop into where the

00:51.200 --> 00:52.670
cursor is.

00:52.670 --> 00:57.750
I will select it and I'm going to go to the side view here and I'll move it up

01:00.470 --> 01:01.820
right around here.

01:01.820 --> 01:07.640
I want the pivot point to be right around here so the pivot point will be where this where the base

01:07.640 --> 01:09.650
of that bone is.

01:09.650 --> 01:12.960
So now I want to create a custom shape for it.

01:14.810 --> 01:23.240
So I'll go back to object mode de-select everything and create a circle and for this I will call this

01:23.330 --> 01:25.140
shape master.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.970
This will be the master control.

01:28.280 --> 01:37.840
And in addition I should probably in edit mode select that bone and let's name this one let me do that.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.140
Let's name this one.

01:39.190 --> 01:53.260
Master Control I'll select that bone in Poser mode and if we come over here to the bone panel custom

01:53.350 --> 02:01.390
shape call the shape and we'll select master and click wireframe.

02:01.420 --> 02:10.060
Now there is the control and what we need to do is rotate it and move it down to the grid floor.

02:11.030 --> 02:16.900
So I'll go into edit mode and let's begin rotating and see what we can do here.

02:18.130 --> 02:19.430
If I rotate it forward.

02:19.450 --> 02:20.690
OK that's good.

02:21.820 --> 02:23.620
Rotates that way.

02:24.130 --> 02:28.430
Well need to scale it some might think.

02:28.570 --> 02:32.230
And then if I move it let's see which way moves it up and down.

02:32.230 --> 02:36.260
This does move like this.

02:36.370 --> 02:40.950
And then I want to move it forward.

02:40.980 --> 02:41.850
That's right.

02:41.860 --> 02:42.980
I'll move this.

02:42.990 --> 02:44.350
No that's not right.

02:44.370 --> 02:50.350
Move it in the z and move it forward like this.

02:50.390 --> 02:53.590
I can see that to be a little bigger.

02:53.670 --> 02:54.510
So there we go.

02:54.540 --> 03:01.240
We've got the master control on the ground floor so we know that when it's zeroed out it's on the ground.

03:01.590 --> 03:06.600
But we also have it so that the pivot point is back here at the thrusters.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.570
So I'll go back to object mode.

03:09.570 --> 03:17.970
Let me select this and I'll move it to that level where we hide all the custom shapes.

03:17.960 --> 03:21.180
Now if I move this around it isn't going to do anything.

03:21.570 --> 03:24.910
I need to parent the proper items to it.

03:25.350 --> 03:35.280
And what I mean by proper items I know I want to parent this I know I want to parent this control to

03:35.280 --> 03:35.610
it.

03:35.820 --> 03:45.420
So I go back to edit mode and I want to parent the body to that master control so I'll select the body

03:45.510 --> 03:54.500
shift select the master control and press control P and keep offset.

03:54.500 --> 04:04.320
Now what else do I want if I select say I select this and pose mode and move it around well now that

04:04.320 --> 04:07.520
we've got this let's select this actually and move it around.

04:07.770 --> 04:09.380
What do I leave behind.

04:09.780 --> 04:19.640
Well I leave behind the feet and the heels but keep in mind the heels are Parenthood to the feet already

04:20.490 --> 04:22.890
and so are the knees.

04:22.890 --> 04:29.310
So I need to parent the feet to the master control.

04:29.460 --> 04:38.510
So I'll take one foot shift select the master control and parent that as well as the other one I to

04:38.540 --> 04:40.180
go.

04:40.190 --> 04:47.900
All right let's go back to pose mode again and I'll say like this one and let's move it and see what

04:47.900 --> 04:48.350
happens.

04:48.350 --> 04:54.760
OK so now we've got almost everything it looks like one of the neat controls is not Parenthood to a

04:54.830 --> 04:57.830
foot control so let's fix that.

05:00.150 --> 05:01.910
I'll come back over here.

05:03.850 --> 05:05.220
Let me test these.

05:05.220 --> 05:08.380
And let me just test this for a quick OK.

05:08.390 --> 05:09.350
That's fine.

05:10.490 --> 05:18.190
Let me go to Edit mode and I will select this and shift select the foot and parent that.

05:18.270 --> 05:20.850
So let's get that OK so now.

05:21.120 --> 05:25.670
Now select this control and pose mode and move it.

05:25.920 --> 05:30.810
So it looks like now all of the feet and the heel and the knees are moving along with it.

05:30.810 --> 05:31.730
That's good.

05:32.040 --> 05:38.850
But we've got problems with the hands the elbows.

05:38.880 --> 05:51.050
Let's work with those so we go back to edit mode select that arm I.K. and shift select the master and

05:51.050 --> 05:52.120
parent it.

05:52.490 --> 05:53.740
Let's try again.

05:53.750 --> 05:58.420
So I come back here to pose mode select them master control and move it.

05:58.430 --> 06:01.610
And why do we leave behind only the spotlight.

06:01.610 --> 06:09.830
All right let's get the spotlight now go back to edit mode shift select the master control P and keep

06:09.830 --> 06:11.440
offset.

06:11.450 --> 06:17.310
So now let's go back to pose mode select that master control and move it around.

06:17.320 --> 06:21.170
And sure enough there we go we can move it.

06:21.170 --> 06:32.930
Now notice that if I go to rotate it'll pivot around that point so it'll hopefully look like the thrusters

06:32.930 --> 06:38.460
are controlling the angle as it's coming down into the scene.

06:39.700 --> 06:47.470
And I also wanted to point out why I put this on the ground plane because if I take this and I move

06:47.470 --> 06:54.400
it move it up you can see that the y increases as I move it up right.

06:55.970 --> 07:05.200
But if I zero it out it goes right back down onto the ground plane the same with the feet.

07:05.210 --> 07:11.970
If I move this up I can zero out the Y and that will plant it back down on the ground.

07:11.970 --> 07:19.260
Now the reason why it's the why and not dizzy is because it's looking at it in local mode.

07:19.880 --> 07:25.670
The last thing I'm going to do here is go back to the armature panel and turn off x rays so we don't

07:25.670 --> 07:32.280
see the controls through the objects and now it looks a little bit better.

07:32.460 --> 07:35.330
It looks a little cleaner.

07:35.580 --> 07:41.650
I think the controls are pretty obvious pretty intuitive as to what they are.

07:41.850 --> 07:47.410
And as I said it's just cleaned up the seam quite a bit so that's about it.

07:47.410 --> 07:50.870
That's the rig for the mech.

07:51.030 --> 07:53.910
What we can do now is begin on the animation.

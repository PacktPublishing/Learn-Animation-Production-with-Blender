WEBVTT

00:00.770 --> 00:07.890
To make room for the environment here I think I want to just take the whole mech just everything here

00:08.310 --> 00:14.620
and press em and move it all to a new layer to move it here to this one.

00:15.030 --> 00:19.450
And that just cleans up this whole area for me to work with.

00:19.560 --> 00:27.880
But it allows me to come over here and turn on this Lehre just to get a sense of scale and proportion.

00:27.880 --> 00:35.580
So periodically I'll be coming over and turning on the air here just so we can get a sense of how big

00:35.580 --> 00:39.260
the environment is compared to the Mac.

00:39.690 --> 00:47.940
So I'll go and turn layer one back on and my thought is that the room or the environment that it's going

00:47.940 --> 00:51.610
to be coming into would look something like this.

00:51.830 --> 00:58.110
Maybe a little bit bigger but I kind of like the general atmosphere of this.

00:58.110 --> 01:02.550
However I like these columns a little better.

01:02.640 --> 01:11.100
To me these just say Egyptian columns a little a little more than these do over here.

01:11.100 --> 01:19.920
Even without all of the hieroglyphics on this I still think of this particular shape says Egyptian to

01:19.920 --> 01:21.550
me more than these do.

01:21.840 --> 01:26.630
So I'm thinking of just general environment kind of like this.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.500
Yet the pillars being like this.

01:29.910 --> 01:32.360
So let's start working on that.

01:33.190 --> 01:39.960
So since those pillars are going to be such a pivotal part of the room and really will help us define

01:39.970 --> 01:43.780
how big this space is going to be I think I'll begin with one of those.

01:44.170 --> 01:52.780
And looking at the reference image I think it's pretty much all cylinders so I'm going to begin with

01:53.260 --> 02:02.380
a cylinder and once again I don't need 32 sides or go with 12 for now and I'll go ahead and change the

02:02.380 --> 02:07.330
cap Phil to triangle fan and let's see what we can do here.

02:07.330 --> 02:14.320
I'll zoom in with the period key and I'm going to go ahead and go to my quad view with control alt queue

02:14.470 --> 02:22.570
for now and I'm a turn off the Tools panel with Tiki and let's see what we can do.

02:22.750 --> 02:23.590
I think I'll

02:26.360 --> 02:30.220
scale this down some and put it in place here.

02:31.890 --> 02:40.950
All right so there's the first base piece I think for the next one I'll make it a separate piece and

02:41.070 --> 02:44.090
since I don't have my tools panel open here.

02:44.100 --> 02:50.760
And of course I could open it but since I don't have it open I'm going to create a new cylinder with

02:51.090 --> 03:02.480
Shift A and that will bring up the ADD menu and I can choose cylinder right here so I'll choose that

03:02.990 --> 03:09.760
and I'll leave the settings the way they are and I'll bring this up and begin placing this here as well.

03:09.800 --> 03:18.170
So I'm thinking that maybe it's going to be about like this.

03:18.370 --> 03:24.760
With that in place I'm going hit the tab key and go into edit mode and I'm going to insert a couple

03:24.760 --> 03:26.380
of edge loops here.

03:26.410 --> 03:36.140
I'm going to insert one to get this bulge out at the base and they'll be they'll need to be a couple

03:36.140 --> 03:46.510
of others here for that top corner piece and I'll maybe insert another there.

03:46.520 --> 03:56.210
So now this edge loop here I think I will hit control of Q to get out of quad view and I'm going to

03:56.210 --> 04:04.610
press shift C to center everything up and maybe I'll just work like this for now.

04:04.850 --> 04:15.540
I'm going to hit the s key and scale this out some and for these up here I think I'll go to face mode

04:15.600 --> 04:25.740
and press alt and click on an edge between two faces to get a loop of faces and then Allt and shift

04:25.770 --> 04:30.360
and do that again and I'll turn my tools tab back on now.

04:30.390 --> 04:40.440
And I think I want to use the extrude normal's tool here so I'll click extrude and region and just pull

04:40.440 --> 04:43.700
those out just a little bit.

04:43.740 --> 04:45.460
Now I want that edge.

04:45.540 --> 04:48.140
I'll just take this edge and scale it out.

04:49.720 --> 04:55.170
For that flare and one of these and scale this out too.

04:55.510 --> 05:04.060
And it almost looks like I need one more edge here down here so that I can grab these faces and scale

05:04.060 --> 05:12.130
these out as well but I don't want to scale it in the z so I'll just hold the shift key down and click

05:12.160 --> 05:17.030
and drag on the z axis here and drag that out just a bit.

05:18.260 --> 05:26.020
And what I'm doing is just getting the basic shape down first just like we've done before.

05:26.600 --> 05:30.690
And then I'll work with adding detail.

05:30.820 --> 05:37.050
Hit the three key and five key just so I can see it from the side view here.

05:38.810 --> 05:44.350
I think that looks good but I think this can be scaled out in the x and y.

05:44.700 --> 05:55.600
A little bit more I'll insert an edge loop up here so that I can once again grab these faces.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.500
Actually I think I'll grab this edge.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.820
Scale it out.

06:04.530 --> 06:13.430
Then grab these faces and scale it out in the x and the Y by shift clicking the z axis here.

06:15.010 --> 06:22.120
And it feels to me like this top part is too big in relation to everything else.

06:22.120 --> 06:29.770
So I think what I'll do now is in wireframe of borders select this I think I just can move this straight

06:29.890 --> 06:37.700
up and perhaps that will allow me to increase the size of this

06:43.350 --> 06:44.600
at something like that.

06:44.600 --> 06:52.640
So now I've just increased the size proportionally and I'll just adjust this now up like this.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.110
All right.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.980
I think that is looking pretty good.

06:57.510 --> 07:04.080
So I'm going to combine these two now with control J and then I'm going to move the origin of the object

07:04.080 --> 07:13.340
down to the 3D cursor or in the center of the grid just so now if I move it around and hit the G key.

07:13.340 --> 07:17.750
Now if I move it around it will move at at the base here.

07:19.170 --> 07:28.040
I'm going to go ahead and bring back the Mac and get a sense of how big this place is.

07:28.540 --> 07:39.340
So my thought is that this body piece is a little bit bigger than the size of a person because a person

07:39.340 --> 07:42.410
is kind of in here controlling the whole thing.

07:43.100 --> 07:52.300
And so if that's the size of the person then that gives me a sense that a person would probably be about

07:52.300 --> 07:55.180
this tall on the column.

07:55.180 --> 07:58.790
So I can get a sense of how tall I think these things should be.

07:59.080 --> 08:04.900
And if I look at my reference image here you can see there's a doorway here.

08:05.050 --> 08:13.950
So a person would probably come up to about here just just beyond the bulge here at the base so I'm

08:13.950 --> 08:17.250
going to take this column back to the center of the grid now now

08:21.840 --> 08:27.570
and I'm going to go ahead and smooth it with a subdivision surface of fire

08:30.970 --> 08:33.760
and smooth the shading.

08:34.450 --> 08:40.210
And now I'm going to add tab into edit mode and begin working on inserting edge loops as we've done

08:40.210 --> 08:41.210
before.

08:41.410 --> 08:49.600
Since these things are kind of aged and weathered it looks like they've got rounded edges here so I'm

08:49.600 --> 08:58.560
going to insert some loops to get some of that I'm going to press the L key and then press shift and

08:58.620 --> 08:59.430
H.

08:59.650 --> 09:09.890
And that will hide everything except the selected piece of the object and I will with the C key the

09:09.890 --> 09:16.220
circle select tool select all of these faces and hit the key to extrude and then scale this in event

09:16.880 --> 09:21.400
and I need to now press alt h to bring everything else back.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.580
I'll insert another loop up here.

09:28.180 --> 09:37.780
I think I'd better expand this whole piece out so I'm going to click on the z axis shift click and expand

09:37.780 --> 09:41.430
that out a bit and then up here at the top.

09:44.180 --> 09:45.660
I don't need to do too much.

09:45.660 --> 09:49.030
It looks like I might insert an edge loop.

09:49.030 --> 09:52.320
Just try and hold that edge just a little bit.

09:52.470 --> 09:57.750
I think maybe just to hold this all I like.

09:57.830 --> 09:58.860
Yes.

10:00.860 --> 10:01.310
All right.

10:01.310 --> 10:13.480
So there is the pillar I'm going to bring back the Mac and I'm going to take a look at placing these

10:13.480 --> 10:19.530
in the room here just to get a sense of how we're doing now once again this can change.

10:19.570 --> 10:24.890
So I'm going to press shift d to duplicate and begin placing these here.

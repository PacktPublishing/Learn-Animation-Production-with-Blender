WEBVTT

00:00.810 --> 00:09.480
Now for the drop to the ground I think what we should do is set up a pose right when he touches the

00:09.480 --> 00:11.960
ground right at that moment.

00:12.420 --> 00:15.570
And that looks like that's around 189 here.

00:15.570 --> 00:22.930
So at that moment when this is touching the ground I mean make sure that is zeroed out.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.530
So the why is zeroed out there.

00:28.480 --> 00:35.410
At that moment we should have a pose where the limbs are kind of dragging or lagging behind.

00:35.710 --> 00:42.340
What I think I want to do is first of all for the legs I'm going to rotate this forward.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.810
Now I don't know if they are going to rotate it here.

00:45.680 --> 00:54.540
Like so and get these you go 3:5 and get these so it's just barely on the ground here.

00:54.540 --> 00:56.470
Like so.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.120
And the arm here.

00:58.130 --> 01:03.630
I'm going to have come up and rotate that hand up like that.

01:03.770 --> 01:09.110
So as if the arms are dragging and following the weight of the body

01:12.800 --> 01:17.550
something like that may be too much but we'll give it a try.

01:21.330 --> 01:25.200
They're looking a little too similar to bring one down.

01:28.960 --> 01:29.320
All right.

01:29.320 --> 01:35.070
So let's see if we drag this back up.

01:37.300 --> 01:39.900
Let me play this and see how this works.

01:45.530 --> 01:47.330
We can almost push it a little more

01:50.390 --> 01:52.620
and have these come up a little higher I think.

01:57.870 --> 01:59.480
All right let's try that.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.720
I feel like these arms need to happen a little quicker.

02:12.300 --> 02:18.620
Maybe these arms need to hold until the absolute point when he drops so I'm going to duplicate these

02:18.630 --> 02:19.970
until that point.

02:25.370 --> 02:27.260
See how that works.

02:36.520 --> 02:39.230
Now the elbows are kind of floating in.

02:39.250 --> 02:44.040
I move the elbows without establishing a stopping point.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.980
So let's see if I can figure that out.

02:51.250 --> 03:00.490
So you see the elbows are back here and they keep on moving because I didn't plant an anchor key frame

03:00.490 --> 03:07.420
here so I'll select these two and duplicate them and move them forward to that point.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.740
So that should anchor those until he drops

03:18.580 --> 03:23.920
the feet I think need an anchor until he drops as well.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.930
So I've got here.

03:25.960 --> 03:34.210
And here I need to duplicate these and move them to the point when he drops this and that's

03:37.030 --> 03:38.020
like so

03:40.930 --> 03:49.840
let's try this.

03:50.160 --> 03:50.520
All right.

03:50.520 --> 03:55.650
I'm going to try this I'm going to go with this for now and move on to the point where he drops down

03:55.650 --> 04:04.630
onto the ground and the weight of the body has to carry through and bend his knees down to the ground.

04:04.800 --> 04:14.210
So now that were to the point where the master control is zeroed out on the on the ground we're going

04:14.210 --> 04:23.830
to leave that there and we're going to continue the motion through this control through the root control.

04:23.840 --> 04:32.550
So I need to go back up and find that it doesn't look like I've cut it yet so I'm going to go ahead

04:32.550 --> 04:33.830
and keep it here.

04:35.310 --> 04:44.820
With location rotation and scale so that root bone is going to be keyed at that point.

04:44.850 --> 04:46.830
Now I should probably

04:49.490 --> 04:51.630
I'm going to go ahead and duplicate it.

04:52.650 --> 04:58.280
You know I'm going to go back to frame one and I'm going to duplicate this key frame and take it all

04:58.280 --> 05:03.200
the way back to frame one just so I have it there.

05:04.510 --> 05:04.910
OK.

05:04.910 --> 05:11.170
So I wanted to just anchor that all the way through.

05:12.020 --> 05:22.980
So now at that point when he hits the ground I need to continue with this movement.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.960
So a couple of things need to happen now.

05:26.050 --> 05:29.850
His feet need to plant on the ground.

05:30.940 --> 05:32.700
Do I have keyframes here yet.

05:32.710 --> 05:35.490
It looks like I've got keyframes here for the feet.

05:36.690 --> 05:37.760
Good.

05:37.930 --> 05:40.930
Looks like I don't have one for this.

05:40.930 --> 05:42.980
Need control.

05:43.020 --> 05:44.850
Let me just get this over here.

05:46.310 --> 05:48.110
And this knee control as well.

05:50.810 --> 05:51.080
All right.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.840
From this point now he needs to drop.

05:53.840 --> 05:58.460
So where is the point that at the lowest point of his drop.

05:58.460 --> 06:07.190
So if I play it and he drops froom it's kind of hard to tell but I'm going to begin at frame 200 here

06:07.760 --> 06:08.660
for the drop.

06:08.660 --> 06:17.540
Now I'm going to extend this out to 50 let's say and I'm going to call 200 the point where he's at its

06:17.540 --> 06:18.500
lowest point.

06:18.500 --> 06:23.900
So his hands will drop the body will drop down the feet will be planted.

06:23.900 --> 06:28.160
Let's go ahead and see if we can get a good pose down for that.

06:28.640 --> 06:32.410
So I'm going to bring this down like this.

06:33.230 --> 06:35.970
And now I want to plant these on the ground.

06:35.990 --> 06:50.060
So what I can do is I could actually press alt G and alt R and that will put that on the ground and

06:50.060 --> 06:55.390
I'll do the same for this at least.

06:55.560 --> 06:58.080
I'll go ahead and do g and all our

07:00.850 --> 07:02.970
So those will plant on the ground.

07:02.980 --> 07:07.800
I think I want to rotate those out a bit

07:17.460 --> 07:18.720
let's just see about that

07:23.360 --> 07:25.320
little bit too slow there.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.140
How about let's see.

07:28.220 --> 07:31.440
So we don't want that to stop.

07:31.500 --> 07:37.280
So if we can move those Any closer and have it work any better.

07:37.280 --> 07:41.960
I'm going to bring this up to 150 here.

07:41.960 --> 07:42.670
Try that

07:46.710 --> 07:47.900
all right a couple of things.

07:47.900 --> 07:55.370
It looks like this foot should really plant back farther.

07:55.460 --> 07:58.280
This foot should be back.

07:58.330 --> 07:58.980
Ron one

08:08.050 --> 08:11.230
I'm going to take a look at that root curve.

08:11.230 --> 08:13.420
Here's the why that's happening.

08:13.480 --> 08:24.280
And if you see hear me expand this out a bit with control middle mouse button and you can see that that

08:25.840 --> 08:28.750
it's going to slow down here and then speed up again.

08:28.750 --> 08:35.320
So when it's flat like this it's it's going to be moving down slowly and when it's angled it's going

08:35.320 --> 08:37.510
to be moving down quickly.

08:37.540 --> 08:47.010
So I think the problem is that we've got this curve easing in.

08:47.140 --> 08:57.020
So I need to take this and free the handles and maybe grab that handle and take it down like this.

08:57.020 --> 08:57.980
Let's try this

09:04.050 --> 09:05.080
a little better.

09:08.610 --> 09:11.410
That foot's not planting real quickly.

09:17.170 --> 09:18.700
Let's move that back like that

09:24.150 --> 09:30.210
so I'm going to take these two now and move them forward here like that.

09:30.210 --> 09:31.590
See how that works.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.500
Getting there.

09:39.430 --> 09:43.210
I kind of want this to move down a little quicker.

09:43.630 --> 09:52.420
So I'm going to split this with the V key and free and choose that handle and I want this to go a little

09:52.420 --> 09:53.430
bit faster.

09:58.060 --> 10:06.280
All right let's take a look at it in perspective view from the camera point of view here just to see

10:06.310 --> 10:12.670
where we are so far to go back to the beginning and let's just see how it looks.

10:12.670 --> 10:16.260
I'll even go ahead and turn on the environment.

10:17.290 --> 10:22.480
And we go so he comes down.

10:22.810 --> 10:25.090
He moves forward.

10:25.090 --> 10:27.790
It's that place and then drops.

10:27.790 --> 10:29.650
All right.

10:29.650 --> 10:35.190
It's not perfect by any means in fact I'm going to do some tweaking here before the next video.

10:35.230 --> 10:45.400
But what I want to do is in the next video get his final pose set up once he's in place on the ground

10:45.700 --> 10:51.590
and then we can work on his final movements as he turns and looks around the room.

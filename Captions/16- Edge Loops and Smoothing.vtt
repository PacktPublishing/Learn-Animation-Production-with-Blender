00:00.960 --> 00:08.060
All right well I've got all the fingers separated out and labeled now and need to work on the leg here.

00:08.070 --> 00:10.930
It is all one object of course.

00:10.950 --> 00:18.090
So in the same way I need to go into edit mode and hover over the upper leg and press the L key as well

00:18.090 --> 00:25.200
as this upper leg joint here and I need to separate them out with the key.

00:26.860 --> 00:38.830
And then I need to select it and give it a name and I'll call this leg up or underscore L and then this

00:39.730 --> 00:47.360
lower leg piece go into edit mode and select these pieces hit the P key.

00:47.440 --> 00:48.520
Separate that out

00:51.470 --> 01:02.000
and we'll call that leg lower underscore Al and now the foot I'm going to zoom in here.

01:02.590 --> 01:05.500
We should split this out.

01:05.740 --> 01:10.810
This piece is going to rotate around the center of this sphere.

01:11.140 --> 01:15.820
And the toe piece is going to rotate around the center of this joint.

01:15.880 --> 01:18.800
So I need to split those out in that way.

01:19.000 --> 01:29.960
So I also like the ankle joint and the heel here and separate these out and we'll call that foot he'll

01:31.080 --> 01:39.590
underscore well and maybe we can call this one here foot toe underscore Al.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.760
There we go.

01:41.760 --> 01:46.010
So now I've got things fairly well broken out and labeled here.

01:46.200 --> 01:53.360
I think now we can begin working on detailing each of the parts to do that.

01:53.370 --> 01:55.680
I'm going to begin smoothing them.

01:55.890 --> 02:03.860
I'm going to select say this body and I'm going to begin applying a subdivision surface modifier.

02:04.140 --> 02:09.680
It looks like I still have a mere modifier on this I'm going to go ahead and apply that.

02:09.750 --> 02:12.010
I don't need that anymore.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.280
I need that to be all one piece now.

02:14.690 --> 02:17.570
And so I'll apply another modifier.

02:17.570 --> 02:22.120
This subdivision surface and that will smooth that object a bit.

02:22.140 --> 02:28.230
I'm also going to come over here to the Tools tab and click on smooth shading and that will help smooth

02:28.230 --> 02:29.080
it up a bit.

02:29.520 --> 02:36.990
And it looks like if I do a subdivision to the view that looks pretty good I think I'll probably go

02:36.990 --> 02:43.720
with that and I'll do the same for the cockpit here now.

02:44.040 --> 02:47.940
I'm going to go through and smooth these pieces and the sphere.

02:47.940 --> 02:50.920
I'm going to leave the fingers unsmooth.

02:51.060 --> 02:53.630
So they're more blocky.

02:53.760 --> 03:02.970
But if you want to add a subdivision surface modifier or any modifier for that matter to multiple objects

03:02.970 --> 03:05.590
you can't just select.

03:05.700 --> 03:14.790
If I selected let's say this hand's fear and the forearm and the upper arm and I went in I said add

03:14.790 --> 03:17.510
subdivision service modifier.

03:17.910 --> 03:23.580
Notice here it only adds it to the the last object I selected.

03:23.580 --> 03:28.750
So it's really now only added to the upper arm.

03:28.800 --> 03:40.480
So what you can do is you can say you can select multiple objects say I'm going to smooth the foot to

03:40.480 --> 03:47.440
heal the lower leg the upper leg as well as the hand and upper arm.

03:47.620 --> 03:52.220
Then I can select an object that is already smooth.

03:52.900 --> 03:59.930
And now if I press control L I can link all of these with the same modifier.

04:00.220 --> 04:08.520
So if I click modifiers now they all are smoothed with their own subdivision surface modifier.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.720
So click smooth over here.

04:10.780 --> 04:11.070
All right.

04:11.080 --> 04:18.250
So now we've got our objects smooth and if you noticed they're a little bit gloppy like down here.

04:18.250 --> 04:24.220
Let's take a look at the toe here you can see it's a little it's kind of collapsed.

04:24.280 --> 04:32.430
Same with the ankle piece here it's kind of collapsed the the edges aren't holding anymore.

04:32.770 --> 04:36.290
And the reason for that is we just don't have enough edges.

04:36.350 --> 04:45.260
When you go through and add edge loops to hold the shape that we want it to be so save for this toe

04:45.260 --> 04:47.720
piece here.

04:47.890 --> 04:49.910
Let's take a look at this.

04:49.930 --> 04:57.660
I'm going to turn the cage off here so we can see the original piece.

04:57.960 --> 05:04.740
And with this I can do something like add edge loops here I can press control are and then scroll the

05:04.800 --> 05:07.340
mouse wheel and and some edge loops here.

05:07.650 --> 05:17.820
Maybe I'll add maybe I'll add five here and that will begin to give me a good shape here.

05:17.820 --> 05:20.770
But there's still more that can be done along the edges.

05:22.530 --> 05:28.330
For the foot I think I'm going to add an edge loop or the toe I'm going to add an edge loop up here

05:29.810 --> 05:31.270
and maybe one down here

05:35.350 --> 05:43.390
and I think I'd like to add an extrusion along here so I'm going to select this and I'm going to hit

05:43.420 --> 05:52.120
E and then go immediately to my scale tool and scale this in a bit and I should be able to hold that

05:52.120 --> 05:54.130
edge a little better now.

05:54.130 --> 05:56.530
So let me go do that to this other side here.

05:59.550 --> 06:04.530
Well hit the click hit s and scale and just a bit.

06:04.530 --> 06:09.540
So now you can see it's looking a little bit more like a hard surface object a little more like we want

06:09.540 --> 06:11.100
it to be.

06:11.100 --> 06:20.910
I can take these edges here and scale them out like this and closer to the edge so that edge will be

06:20.910 --> 06:25.120
a little bit tighter now on both sides.

06:25.200 --> 06:38.610
I think what I'm also going to do is select these faces here and these faces here and I'm going to create

06:38.610 --> 06:44.820
little bolts or indentations Here let me show you what I mean.

06:45.180 --> 06:51.060
So with both of those sides selected what I can do is hit extrude.

06:51.060 --> 06:53.340
And now I want to scale them in.

06:53.340 --> 06:54.950
Now if I hit s.

06:55.020 --> 06:57.800
Watch what happens as they scale and like that.

06:57.810 --> 06:59.850
And that's not what I want.

06:59.850 --> 07:07.650
I want to scale them in the z and the Y but not together in the X here.

07:07.820 --> 07:12.220
What I can do is I can shift click and drag the axis.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.520
I do not want to scale in.

07:14.610 --> 07:16.010
So let me show you what I mean.

07:16.020 --> 07:23.580
I'm going to press shift and click on the x axis and then scale and then drag and notice they're scaling

07:23.580 --> 07:25.100
in only the axes.

07:25.150 --> 07:32.060
I'm not selecting maybe something like that.

07:32.150 --> 07:38.370
And then if I hit you again now I can scale them out in the X

07:40.870 --> 07:53.430
go and then if I hit E again I can shift click the X and scale them in again like this.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.690
So there we go.

07:55.840 --> 08:04.330
Now I could even insert one more edge loop around here like this and tighten that up a bit.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.160
And over here as well.

08:12.090 --> 08:14.820
What if we wanted to bring these faces in.

08:14.820 --> 08:22.860
So let me show you what I mean if I select these faces by pressing Allt and clicking on one of the edges

08:24.190 --> 08:32.000
to make an edge loop I'll do the same thing over here with Allt shift like this.

08:32.040 --> 08:38.570
Now what if I wanted to extrude those in what I could do is I get it easy and immediately click.

08:38.570 --> 08:46.470
I'm going to hit E again and click and this time I'm going to shift select or shift click and drag that

08:46.500 --> 08:50.720
x axis so that will collapse in a bit.

08:50.820 --> 08:54.520
I couldn't I could bring them out or in whichever you want.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.120
So.

08:56.320 --> 09:04.510
So now what I do is press control are an insert say two edge loops here and then scale them out to hold

09:04.510 --> 09:06.600
that edge.

09:06.850 --> 09:14.920
And I can do the same thing over here two edge loops click and then scale these out like that.

09:14.920 --> 09:25.420
So these are just ways of getting extra detail into your objects and smoothing them without losing the

09:25.510 --> 09:27.850
shape that you want.

09:27.850 --> 09:30.250
Let's take a look at this ankle piece.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.690
Now I'm just going to work on this.

09:32.980 --> 09:35.740
Same thing applies.

09:35.890 --> 09:39.430
What I would like to do is tighten up these edges.

09:39.430 --> 09:43.240
They look a little bit like they've kind of collapsed.

09:43.600 --> 09:49.570
So what I'll do first is work on this edge here I'm going to press control are and that will insert

09:49.570 --> 09:51.220
an edge loop right up here.

09:51.220 --> 09:57.130
I can insert an edge loop right up here on top and I'm going to scroll the mouse wheel to insert two

09:57.130 --> 10:03.400
of them click and that holds that edge a little better.

10:03.400 --> 10:11.440
Now I'm going to take a look down here maybe I can insert an edge loop or maybe two of them down here

10:13.940 --> 10:18.340
like so and maybe I can even insert a loop down here.

10:23.360 --> 10:30.770
And move it in a bit to hold that shape and click something like that.

10:30.800 --> 10:39.290
So now that I've got a little bit more of a hard edge along that joint I think I will also turn this

10:39.440 --> 10:39.950
off.

10:39.950 --> 10:46.160
I will also insert one more edge loop down here at the bottom to hold this like so

10:50.320 --> 10:51.180
there we go.

10:51.420 --> 10:55.470
So it just looks a little more mechanical and machined.

10:55.800 --> 11:02.970
So what I'm going to do is work my way up the leg and up the arm and begin putting a little detail into

11:02.970 --> 11:04.830
these by inserting edge loops.

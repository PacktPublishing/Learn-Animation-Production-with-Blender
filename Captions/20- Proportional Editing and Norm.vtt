00:00.930 --> 00:10.890
To create a rim or seal around this cockpit I think what I'll do is use a circle and then try the proportional

00:10.890 --> 00:17.110
editing tool to get it to mold to the shape of the body.

00:17.130 --> 00:18.020
So let's try that.

00:18.030 --> 00:26.990
I'm going to first select the cockpit and move the pivot point or the 3D cursor to that point.

00:28.260 --> 00:35.250
And then I'll create a circle over here on the Create tab and

00:38.350 --> 00:47.170
I'm going to go ahead and leave it at 32 sides here because we may need that amount of resolution to

00:47.170 --> 00:50.590
get it to bend in the way that we want.

00:50.600 --> 00:59.810
So let's try to at least go to the rotate tool and the side view and orthographic view with the five

00:59.810 --> 01:07.400
key I'm going to hit the period key on the numpad to zoom in and Z for wireframe.

01:07.400 --> 01:14.870
Now I want to just hit the Archey and rotate this until I get it about angled the way the cockpit is

01:14.870 --> 01:19.440
just approximately like that.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.480
Now I'm going to go to the front view and take a look at it here.

01:22.770 --> 01:24.470
I could scale it a bit.

01:24.510 --> 01:25.590
Let me do that.

01:27.610 --> 01:35.260
So now that I have the circle in place and roughly the right size I'm going to tab into Edit Mode go

01:35.260 --> 01:47.160
to vertex mode de-select them and if I took Say this point up here and began moving it back I'd have

01:47.240 --> 01:54.990
I'd be spending a lot of time moving all these back to fit the shape of the body.

01:55.150 --> 01:57.640
If I were doing it one by one here.

01:57.910 --> 02:06.400
So what I want to do is use this proportional editing tool down here and I can pull out this menu and

02:06.400 --> 02:16.030
I can choose enabled the shortcut key for this is the key on the keyboard so you can toggle proportional

02:16.030 --> 02:18.610
editing tool on and off with the key.

02:19.120 --> 02:28.330
And now if I I'm going to move up here if I hit the G key you can see that there's this circle around

02:28.330 --> 02:28.910
the point.

02:28.930 --> 02:36.520
And if I scroll the scroll wheel on the mouse it will increase and decrease the size.

02:36.520 --> 02:43.990
Now what this is is the circle of influence so in the center of the circle is the most influence for

02:44.050 --> 02:46.410
the move tool that I have selected here.

02:46.510 --> 02:53.800
Moving out toward the edge of the influence of this circle decreases so you can see if I move this it's

02:54.130 --> 02:59.500
moving it proportionally it's moving it at the point that's selected the most.

02:59.500 --> 03:05.020
And then as it moves out to the edge of the circle it's less and less influence.

03:05.920 --> 03:14.660
So with this I can begin to move these points back toward the body of the neck.

03:14.850 --> 03:20.790
Now I feel like I need to change the influence of this year so I'm going to hit the G key again and

03:20.790 --> 03:24.270
scroll the mouse wheel to make it a little bit bigger.

03:24.420 --> 03:31.830
And then click and now I can use my move manipulator to move this point with the proportional editing

03:31.830 --> 03:41.020
tool here so I can move it like that and go and I'll come down here and do the same for this point down

03:41.020 --> 03:41.740
here.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.050
And move it kind of like this.

03:45.050 --> 03:53.230
So I'm just kind of trying to get this so it lines up with the shape of the mech.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.620
Now I want to move my cursor back to the center it's kind of in the way here.

03:57.740 --> 04:02.570
I'm also going to use my border select to drag select some points here.

04:02.570 --> 04:09.410
Now the reason why I used the border select is to select both of these you can see there's two here

04:10.940 --> 04:12.950
I can de-select this one down here.

04:12.950 --> 04:19.910
Now go back to the side view I can move it in just a little bit.

04:21.060 --> 04:24.140
Hit the big key and drag a pare down here.

04:27.210 --> 04:35.530
And I'm trying to do is get the circle to line up with the basic shape of the body here that's all.

04:35.530 --> 04:47.250
So now what I'll do is just with it selected in Edge mode and you go to Edit Mode edge select all hit

04:47.810 --> 04:56.670
the key and click and then go back to the move tool and I'm just going to pull this back.

04:57.160 --> 05:01.770
Notice that I pulled back with the proportional editing tool.

05:01.780 --> 05:03.820
That's not going to help me.

05:03.820 --> 05:11.250
I need to disable the proportional editing tool to do that I can just hit the okey.

05:11.510 --> 05:20.800
So now if I pull down that should extrude out the circle and then if I select this edge again I'm going

05:20.800 --> 05:23.220
to hit the for extrude Aamna click.

05:23.260 --> 05:25.960
I'll press the s key and scale in some

05:29.280 --> 05:36.830
and then once again I'll hit the click and pull in.

05:36.990 --> 05:44.480
And one last time I'll hit the click and the ESC key and scale in.

05:44.490 --> 05:51.450
So now you may notice that this object is a little bit different color than all the rest.

05:51.510 --> 05:54.110
It's more of a bluish here I guess.

05:54.360 --> 06:00.560
But the reason why that is I believe is that the normals are facing the wrong way.

06:00.810 --> 06:09.210
And what I mean by that is that the polygons are flipped polygons have a front and a back and there

06:09.210 --> 06:16.420
is a line an imaginary line coming out of the front of every polygon that people call the normal.

06:16.590 --> 06:22.150
And it just dictates which is the front of a polygon and which is the back.

06:22.170 --> 06:29.310
Now to flip this what we need to do is tab into edit mode and I'm don't like all the faces then I'm

06:29.310 --> 06:39.280
going to go to control f and that's the faces menu and you can see up here at the top is flip normal's.

06:39.300 --> 06:46.680
And if we click that that will flip the polygon so that they are facing out so that the front of the

06:46.680 --> 06:49.080
polygons are facing toward us.

06:49.260 --> 06:55.230
And now you can see that the color of the object is a little bit more similar to the rest and that's

06:55.230 --> 07:02.070
just Blender's way of letting you know that a polygon is flipped and needs to be reversed so now that

07:02.070 --> 07:08.240
we have that I'm going to go in and change the name here or call this cockpit trim and.

07:08.430 --> 07:17.590
Let's go ahead and add a subdivision surface modifier and I will go ahead and add the views about 2

07:18.250 --> 07:26.440
and I can also under the Tools tab smooth the shading.

07:26.440 --> 07:33.530
So I think what I will do is maybe insert just one edge loop along here and see how that looks.

07:36.270 --> 07:44.910
And also I believe what I could do is take this edge that I pulled back into here and scale this up

07:44.910 --> 07:51.480
so it flares out a bit and we go.

07:52.140 --> 07:59.120
So that just helps clean off and finish the cockpit there just to give it some trim around there.

07:59.190 --> 08:01.400
So I think that helps.

08:01.410 --> 08:07.440
Another thing I'd like to do with the body here is to go ahead and delete half and measure it over again

08:07.470 --> 08:16.380
because the information on the shoulder over here the modeling information hasn't yet been duplicated

08:16.380 --> 08:19.320
over or mirrored over to the other side.

08:19.350 --> 08:27.120
So I think I just need to mirror that over so select the body press the division key on the keyboard

08:27.120 --> 08:29.020
here to isolate it.

08:29.550 --> 08:38.960
And I'm going to turn off the subdivision surface modifier for the time being and tab into edit mode.

08:39.540 --> 08:46.750
Go to face's wireframe front view and perspective.

08:47.090 --> 08:53.570
And I do all that just so I can see the polygons a little easier because what I want to do is go to

08:53.570 --> 08:58.700
the border select tool with the Beaky and click and drag and delete half.

08:58.730 --> 09:02.650
So I'll just take this and delete it.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.070
Delete faces.

09:06.300 --> 09:12.180
And now if I tab back into object mode let's see where the pivot point is.

09:12.180 --> 09:12.720
That's good.

09:12.720 --> 09:21.080
It's still down here at the center of the grid I'll now go ahead and add another modifier the mirror

09:21.320 --> 09:23.800
modifier.

09:23.830 --> 09:35.970
Turn on clipping and I'll go ahead and hit apply so that now should have sealed up the main body and

09:37.000 --> 09:43.660
if I go back here into perspective mode you can see that that information on the shoulder has been mirrored

09:43.660 --> 09:45.300
over.

09:45.340 --> 09:45.700
All right.

09:45.700 --> 09:50.710
So I'll hit the division key on the numpad again.

09:51.130 --> 09:54.340
Let's make sure it's all sealed up here.

09:54.780 --> 09:57.160
Yeah looks good.

09:57.160 --> 09:57.570
All right.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.010
So we're coming along.

09:59.110 --> 10:05.550
I think I may add a couple of little details on the body and the jet pack.

10:05.950 --> 10:11.200
But then after that we'll just need to mirror the leg and the arm over and I think we'll be done.

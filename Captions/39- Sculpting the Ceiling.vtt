00:00.750 --> 00:08.190
The other two pieces I'd like to use the sculpt tools on our this beam here this shortened beam and

00:08.190 --> 00:11.130
also the whole of the ceiling.

00:11.790 --> 00:18.330
So let's work on this beam right now I'm going to go ahead and zoom in and isolate it with the division

00:18.330 --> 00:19.150
key.

00:19.470 --> 00:30.420
And what I want to do is just beat up this end here just a bit so it gets the feeling that it was broken

00:30.420 --> 00:31.560
off.

00:31.560 --> 00:39.030
So what I want to do is add a multi resolution modifier increased the subdivisions a bit here.

00:39.050 --> 00:46.240
Now you notice once again that it's beginning to collapse because we're using Catmull Clark.

00:46.250 --> 00:53.660
I'm going to change it to simple so we can increase the resolution with out the edges rounding off.

00:53.670 --> 01:00.300
So all right maybe I'll even give it one more subdivision and let me go into the sculped tools here.

01:01.450 --> 01:04.360
And I'll go ahead and use the sculped brush here.

01:04.360 --> 01:10.660
The sculped draw and let me just zoom in and see what we can do here.

01:10.710 --> 01:19.470
All hit the F key to reduce the size of the brush and I'll press shift F to increase the strength.

01:19.470 --> 01:23.940
And if I just yeah I think I can do something with this.

01:23.980 --> 01:25.840
I'll cut in.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.070
I'll pull out something like this.

01:31.960 --> 01:37.760
Just so we get a sense that there something kind of broke off of here.

01:37.910 --> 01:40.060
Here we go something like that.

01:40.060 --> 01:47.880
Now I can come in here and maybe I'll use the pinch tool and pinch up some of these edges here so they're

01:47.920 --> 01:58.680
a little bit sharper and I think that should probably do just to give the sense from a distance here

01:59.340 --> 02:03.900
that that's kind of crumbled stone.

02:04.040 --> 02:04.370
All right.

02:04.370 --> 02:07.300
Let's take a look at the other piece.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.790
The hole in the ceiling.

02:10.340 --> 02:17.290
I will select this piece and I'll zoom in a bit and let's do a similar thing here.

02:17.660 --> 02:21.190
So I'm going to go to the sculped mode again.

02:21.500 --> 02:25.530
Use the sculpt draw brush.

02:25.740 --> 02:38.630
I'll add a multi resolution modifier subdivide a bit maybe up to three and change from Catmull Clark

02:38.630 --> 02:41.710
to simple for this one.

02:43.150 --> 02:50.200
I think I'll reduce the size of the brush and maybe just work going up and down here like this.

02:51.150 --> 02:53.780
Maybe I'll need one more subdivision.

02:54.820 --> 02:55.860
And here we go.

02:57.340 --> 03:04.580
And I'll also hold the control key down and cut into it some as well as pushing out.

03:05.150 --> 03:16.690
So my goal here here isn't have it be perfect just to have it be rough and not so smooth.

03:17.750 --> 03:23.520
And we really don't need it all the way around because we're not going to see that part.

03:24.800 --> 03:31.280
I'll spin around and get some of this over here just to make sure we get what we need.

03:33.360 --> 03:43.290
And I'll also do some pushing in and also sculpting around here and going back and forth between just

03:44.610 --> 03:52.600
sculpting and using the control button just kind of going back and forth here.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.540
I may smooth some of that back.

03:55.540 --> 04:02.700
It looks like I did a little too much so I'm going to increase the size of the brush and hold the shift

04:02.700 --> 04:11.700
key down and just smooth it back just a little don't need it quite that much OK.

04:11.700 --> 04:16.550
So I will go back to object mode.

04:16.710 --> 04:22.480
We can increase the views here in Object mode just to see how we're doing.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.230
I'll press shift see

04:28.390 --> 04:37.200
and let's go ahead and take a look at it through the camera here and press the zero key and maybe switch

04:37.200 --> 04:38.670
to rendered view.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.290
And let's see what we have here.

04:42.510 --> 04:49.230
Yes or that kind of gives the sense that there is a little more happening there than just flat polygons

04:49.230 --> 04:51.290
like things have kind of broken off.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.750
Will work.

04:54.900 --> 05:01.450
So that is about all the sculpting I'd like to do for our scene in the final render.

05:01.470 --> 05:10.140
I'm going to have a light coming down through the hole in the ceiling here and we'll also have a light

05:10.140 --> 05:12.970
shining out of his spotlight.

05:13.810 --> 05:18.670
So at the very least I think what I want to do right now is set up a light that's coming down to the

05:18.670 --> 05:22.590
hole in the ceiling and have that be our main source of light.

05:23.050 --> 05:28.260
So to do that I'm going to delete the light plane in this scene here we don't need that anymore.

05:28.420 --> 05:32.150
So just selected and press X and delete.

05:32.350 --> 05:40.900
And what I think I'll do is place a spotlight up here outside the whole shining in.

05:40.900 --> 05:49.630
So I'm going to come down here to the lamp area in the create tab and click spot and then move this

05:49.630 --> 05:50.120
up.

05:50.120 --> 05:55.060
Now we're going to move this up like this.

05:55.540 --> 06:04.360
And I think I'll shine it down in kind of like this kind of angled and shining down into this scene

06:04.420 --> 06:05.680
on to him.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.570
Let me split the screens here.

06:07.570 --> 06:08.770
I'll take this tab.

06:08.770 --> 06:10.760
This corner tab and pull it down.

06:12.380 --> 06:20.070
And I'll press the zero key appear to frame up the actual render camera.

06:20.410 --> 06:27.740
And while this is here I can adjust the light as needed so I'm going to switch the viewport shading

06:27.740 --> 06:29.910
to rendered.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.870
And so you can see our scene here.

06:32.870 --> 06:38.960
We're going to need a little more light on the scene with my spotlight select it I'm going to come over

06:38.960 --> 06:43.760
here to the spotlight panel and under-strength.

06:43.850 --> 06:44.850
I'll try.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.840
I'll switch from a hundred to maybe 1000.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.430
That's a little bit better.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.690
How about 10000.

06:52.770 --> 06:55.710
Let's try that getting there.

06:56.190 --> 06:57.090
Let me try.

06:57.090 --> 06:59.850
Twenty thousand.

06:59.850 --> 07:02.310
See how that works.

07:02.310 --> 07:08.760
Another thing I can do here is move this down and zoom this in a bit.

07:08.760 --> 07:12.650
Another thing I can do is adjust the size of the cone.

07:12.650 --> 07:13.890
Angle here.

07:14.040 --> 07:22.380
So I right down here under the spot shape I can increase or decrease the size of the lamp.

07:22.470 --> 07:30.000
So I just want to kind of spotlight the Mac as it comes down into this scene as the light comes through

07:30.000 --> 07:31.520
the hole here.

07:31.650 --> 07:37.950
So the light is looking pretty good there but I feel like we need a little bit more light in the scene

07:38.310 --> 07:40.800
if I come over here to the world panel.

07:40.920 --> 07:51.470
I can turn on ambient inclusion and that's a bit too much so let's try point one for the ambient occlusion.

07:51.570 --> 07:52.420
OK.

07:52.420 --> 07:58.100
How about point 0 5 something like that.

07:58.150 --> 08:05.480
Something very low just to give us a little bit of extra light in the scene.

08:05.530 --> 08:14.890
I'm going to join these two windows by right clicking between them and clicking join and then click

08:14.890 --> 08:17.050
down here.

08:17.050 --> 08:23.030
All right so that's I think a rough approximation of what I would like the scene to look like.
